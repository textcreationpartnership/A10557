            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16242:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>they attribute not ≈øuch authority, as is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church their Mother; they duely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not her loyalty unto Chri≈øt her Head.

And if they bee demanded, whence they have received ≈øo great an extraordinary abilitie, as to judge of their mother the Church her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Doctrine?

This is the Chri≈øtian faith, which the≈øe Holy men had, and wee al≈øo ought to haue. And although they were not named Chri≈øtian men, yet was it a Chri≈øtian faith that they had, for they looked for all the benefits of God the Father, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Sonne Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, as wee now doe. This difference is betweene them and vs, that they looked when Chri≈øt ≈øhould come, and we be in the time when hee is come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ≈øayth Saint</hi> Augu≈øtine, the time is altered and changed, but not the Faith. For wee haue both one faith in one <hi>CHRIST.</hi> The ≈øame Holy Gho≈øt al≈øo that wee haue, had they, ≈øayth Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> For as the Holy Gho≈øt doeth teach vs to tru≈øt in God, and to call vppon him as our Father: So did hee likewi≈øe in≈øtruct and teach them to ≈øay, as it is Written,<note n="*" place="margin">E≈øay 63.16.</note> Thou Lord art our Father and redeemer, and thy name is without beginning, and euerla≈øting.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16242:26"/>God gaue them grace to bee his Children, as hee doth vs now. But now by the comming of our Sauior Chri≈øt, wee haue receiued more aboundantly the Spirit of God in our hearts, whereby we may conceiue a greater faith and ≈øurer tru≈øt, than many of them had. But in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they and wee be all one: Wee haue the ≈øame faith that they had in God, and they the ≈øame that we haue. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øo much extolleth their faith, becau≈øe we ≈øhould no le≈ø≈øe, but rather more, giue our ≈øelues wholly vnto Chri≈øt, both in profe≈ø≈øion and liuing, now when Chri≈øt is come, than the olde Fathers did before his comming.</p>
               <p>And by all the declaration of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that the true, liuely, and Chri≈øtian faith, is no dead, vaine, or vnfruitfull thing, but a thing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vertue, of wonderfull Operation or working, and ≈øtrength, bringing foorth all good motions, and good Workes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>An Archbi≈øhop therefore in the ≈øeruice of con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating is called, <hi>Mo≈øt Reuerend Father in God:</hi> vnto whom, euery Bi≈øhop con≈øecrated to Dioce≈ø≈øe within his Prouince, profe≈ø≈øeth and promi≈øeth by oath all due reuerence and obedience; like as euery Prie≈øt doth vnto the Bi≈øhop, within who≈øe Dioce≈ø≈øe he is Pa≈øtour.</p>
               <p>Now that ≈øuch an order among the Bi≈øhops is of Diuine ordinance, it is euident from that, the fir≈øt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons named Bi≈øhops in the Primitiue Chri≈øtian Church,<note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 1.6.</note>

               <p>But ≈øome there are which ≈øay that ≈øuch di≈øtinction was not by Chri≈øt or dained to continue in his Church: but onely was appointed in the primitiue ≈øtate thereof, whiles Churches were in planting, and is now long agoe quite cea≈øed. The which affirmation is no where deliuered in Holy Scripture, nor intimated; neither from any ≈øentence therein can be truly concluded.</p>
               <p>But the direct contrary Doctrine is deliuered by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Ephe≈øians, and that in mo≈øt expre≈ø≈øe manner.

               <p>It is al≈øo here to be noted that the name Apo≈øtle v≈øed in the new Te≈øtament, doth imply two degrees. Whence it is thought meete to tran≈ølate it ≈øometimes by the word<note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 2.25. 2. Cor 8.23.1. 2. Cor. 11.5. Gal. 2.9.</note> me≈ø≈øenger.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is in Scripture mention of the chiefe≈øt Apo≈øtles, it implyeth that there was ≈øome di≈øparity among the Apo≈øtles.</p>
               <p>And what degree or order is that inferiour, if it be not that<note n="w" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.5.</note> Euangeli≈øt≈øhip, which is aboue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtor≈øhip,

               <p>Truely therefore and properly in the Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice are Bi≈øhops ≈øignified to be the Apo≈øtles of Chri≈øts Church, as where it is ≈øayd in the Seruice of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: <hi>We make our humble ≈øupplications vnto thee for the≈øe children, vpon whom (after the example of the holy Apo≈øtles) we haue laide our hands, to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them (by this ≈øigne) of thy fauour and gracious goodne≈ø≈øe toward them.</hi>

And wherein is our communication? not in the commendation of vertuous and good deeds, of ho≈øpitality, of love between Chri≈øtian brother and brother, of love betweene man and wife, of virginity and cha≈øtity, and of Almes toward the poore. Not in P≈øalmes and godly ≈øongs, not in lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for our ≈øinnes, not in repre≈øsing the affections of the body, not in prayers to God. We talke of Scripture, but in the meane time we ≈øubdue not our fle≈øh by fa≈øting, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and weeping: wee make not this life a meditation of death, we doe not ≈øtrive to be lords ouer our appetites and affections. We goe not about to pull downe our proud and high minds, to abate our fumi≈øh and rancorous ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, to re≈øtraine our lu≈øts and bodily delectations, our undi≈øcreet ≈øorrowes, our la≈øcivious mirth, ovr inordinate looking, our un≈øatiable hearing of vanities, our ≈øpeaking without mea≈øure, our inconvenient thoughts; and briefly, to reforme our life and manners: but all our holine≈ø≈øe con≈øi≈øteth in talking. And we pardon each other from all good living, ≈øo that we may ≈øticke fa≈øt together in argumentation, as though there were no more wayes to heaven but this alone, the way of ≈øpeculation and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16242:84"/>(as they take it.) But in very deed it is rather the way of ≈øuperfluous contention and ≈øophi≈øtication. The ≈øame Author ≈øaith al≈øo in another place; That the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Chri≈øtian man ought to begin of the feare of God, and to end in matters of high ≈øpeculation: and not contrarily to begin with ≈øpeculation and to end in feare. For ≈øpeculation <hi>(≈øaith he)</hi> either high cunning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if it be not ≈øtayed with the bridle of feare to offend God, is dangerous, and enough to tumble a man headlong downe the hill. Therefore ≈øaith he: The feare of God mu≈øt be the fir≈øt beginning, and as it were an <hi>A. B. C.</hi> or an introduction to all them that ≈øhall enter into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true and mo≈øt fruitfull knowledge of holy Scriptures. Where as is the feare of God, there is (≈øaith he) the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandements: and where as is the keeping of the Commandements, there is the clean≈øing of the fle≈øh: which fle≈øh is a cloud before the ≈øoules eye, and ≈øuffereth it not purely to ≈øee the beame of the heavenly light. Where as is the clean≈øing of the fle≈øh, there is the illumination of the holy Gho≈øt, the end of all our de≈øires, and the very light whereby the verity of Scriptures is ≈øeene and perceived.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 54.</hi> Of Comfirmation, commonly called Bi≈øhopping.</head>
               <p>THe order of confirmation, ≈øet afore the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi≈øme in the divine ≈øervice, giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the rea≈øon of the ≈øame, in the three con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions delivered, for the which unto none confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16242:90"/>is to be mini≈øtred, ≈øave only unto ≈øuch, as can ≈øay that Catechi≈øme, <hi>viz. Fir≈øt, becau≈øe that when children come to the yeares of di≈øcretion, and have learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promi≈øed for them in Bapti≈øme, they may then them≈øelves with their owne mouth, and with their owne con≈øent, openly before the Church, rati≈øie and confirme the ≈øame: And al≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe by the grace of God, they will evermore endeavour them≈øelves faithfully to ob≈øerve and keepe ≈øuch things, as they by their owne mouth and confe≈øsion have a≈ø≈øented unto. Secondly, fora≈ømuch as Confirmation is mini≈øtred to them that be baptized, that by impo≈øition of hands and prayer, they may receive ≈øtrength and defence again≈øt all temptations to ≈øinne, and the a≈ø≈øaults of the world and the Devill, it is mo≈øt meet to bee mini≈øtred when children come to that age, that partly by the frailty of their owne fle≈øh, partly by the a≈ø≈øaults of the world and the Devill, they begin to bee in danger to fall into ≈øundry kindes of ≈øinne. Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the u≈øage of the Church in times pa≈øt: Whereby it was ordained that confirmation ≈øhould bee mini≈øtred to them that were of perfect age, that they being in≈øtructed in Chri≈øts religion, ≈øhould openly profe≈ø≈øe their owne faith, and promi≈øe to bee obedient to the will of God.</hi> In the prayer to be ≈øaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the act of confirmation, there are mentioned together the ≈øundry<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 24.</note> graces, wherein we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire for to be confirmed, where it is ≈øaid: <hi>≈øtrengthen them, wee be≈øeech thee, O Lord, with the holy Gho≈øt the comforter, and daily increa≈øe in them thy manifold gifts of grace, the ≈øpirit of wi≈øedom and under≈øtanding, the ≈øpirit of Coun≈øell and gho≈øtly ≈øtrength, the ≈øpirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and true godline≈ø≈øe, and ful≈øill them (O Lord) with the ≈øpirit of thy holy feare.</hi> And the words of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16242:91"/>firmation or Bi≈øhopping it ≈øelfe are pronuonced by the Bi≈øhop laying his hand upon every child ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ≈øaying: <hi>Defend, O Lord, this child with thy heauenly grace, that hee may continue thine for ever, and daily increa≈øe in thy holy ≈øpirit more and more, untill hee come unto thine everla≈øting kingdome.</hi> And the rea≈øon of the laying the hands is delivered in the prayer to bee ≈øaid when Confirmation is done, where it is ≈øaid: <hi>Wee make our humble ≈øupplications unto thee for the≈øe children, upon whom (after the example of the holy Apo≈øtles) wee have laid our hands, to certifie them (by this ≈øigne) of thy favour and gratious goodne≈ø≈øe toward them: Let thy fatherly hand, we be≈øeech thee, ever bee over them: Let thy holy ≈øpirit ever bee with them, and ≈øo lead them in the knowledge and obedience of thy word, that in the end they may obtaine the everla≈øting life throughour Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Al≈øo in the rubricke at the end of the Catechi≈øme, it is ≈øaid, <hi>every Child ≈øhall bee brought to the Bi≈øhop, by one that ≈øhall be his Godfather or Godmother, that every child may have a witne≈ø≈øe of his Confirmation.</hi> Holy Church in her Lawes called Con≈øtitutions &amp; Canons Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hath two Canons concerning Confirmation: the<note n="*" place="margin">Canon 60.</note> one, <hi>that it is to bee performed once in three yeares:</hi> the<note n="*" place="margin">Canon 61.</note> other, <hi>that mini≈øters are to prepare Children for Confirmation.</hi> In the ≈øixtieth Canon it is ≈øaid: <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈ømuch as it hath beene a ≈øolemne, ancient, and laudable cu≈øtom in the Church of God, continued from the Apo≈øtles times, that all Bi≈øhops ≈øhould lay their hands, upon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized and in≈øtructed in the Catechi≈øme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion, praying over them, and ble≈øsing them, which wee commonly call Confirmation, and that this holy action hath beene accu≈øtomed in the Church in the former
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16242:91"/>ages, to be performed in the Bi≈øhops vi≈øitation every third yeere, &amp;c.</hi> Confirmation or laying on of hands is an ordinance of the Go≈øpel of ≈øo great importance, as that by the Apo≈øtle to the Hebrewes it is ≈øet as the fourth principle of the doctrine of Chri≈øt, where he reckoneth up together the ≈øixe principles of the Oracles of God, ≈øaying;<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 6, 1, 2.</note> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chri≈øt, let us goe on unto perfection, not laying againe the foundation, of repentance from dead workes, and of faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of the doctrine of bapti≈ømes, and of laying on of hands, and of the re≈øurrection of the dead, and of the eternall judgement. It is written in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that ≈øundry whom the Deacon <hi>Philip</hi> had baptized and in≈øtructed in the Chri≈øtian faith, had Confirmation or<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 8.17.</note> laying on of hands from the Apo≈øtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ≈øo received the holy Gho≈øt. It is al≈øo recorded that <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 19.6.</note> laid his hands upon ≈øome per≈øons afore baptized, and they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Gho≈øt. The Apo≈øtles are ≈øaid to have<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 14.22.</note> confirmed the ≈øoules of the Di≈øciples, and to have<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 18.23.</note> ≈øtrengthened them, after they had beene conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>IN the holy Catechi≈øme it is delivered concerning the Sacrament of Lords Supper, <hi>That it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the continuall remembrance of the ≈øacrifice of the death of Chri≈øt, and the benefits which we receive therby. The outward part or ≈øigne of the Lords ≈øupper is bread and wine, which the Lord hath commanded to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The inward part or thing ≈øignified, is the body and blood of Chri≈øt, which are verily and indeed taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the faithfull in the Lords Supper. The benefits whereof we are partakers thereby, is the ≈øtrengthening and refre≈øhing of our ≈øoules by the body and blood of Chri≈øt, as our bodies are by the bread and wine.</hi> The my≈øtery of this Sacrament is mo≈øt divinely declared in the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Communion. In the ≈øecond Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there it is ≈øaid; <hi>Our heavenly Father hath given his Sonne our Saviour Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, not only to dye for us, but al≈øo to be our ≈øpirituall food</hi>

                  <hi>Peace be to this hou≈øe, and to all that dwell in it. And that when he commeth into the ≈øicke mans pre≈øence, hee ≈øhall ≈øay kneeling down, Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber not Lord our iniquities, &amp;c.</hi> Then there is pre≈øcribed a very Divine Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation divided into two parts, wherewith the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter is to exhort the ≈øicke per≈øon; the which is mo≈øt profitable for all people to meditate on, when they feele them≈øelves ill at ea≈øe, or in any adver≈øitie. And the Exhortation being read, <hi>the Mini≈øter is to examine whether he continueth in beliefe of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chri≈øtian faith, and whether he be in charity with all the world, &amp;c. And to exhort him for to ≈øet his ≈øtate in order: (whereto men, when they be in health, ≈øhould be oft admoni≈øhed) and earne≈øtly to move him to liberalitie toward the poore,</hi> becau≈øe it is the la≈øt Almes that ever hee ≈øhall give.</p>
               <p>The Church hath ordained an Homily, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation again≈øt the feare of death to be read unto the people. And if the ≈øicke per≈øon can well indure to heare the reading of it, he may be much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ≈øame. The vi≈øitation of the ≈øicke is one of the<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 25.35.26.</note> ≈øixe duties of Charitie, whereof Ie≈øus Chri≈øt will ≈øpeake when he ≈øitteth to judge all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>Moreover, concerning the reverence done by ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up, when we make confe≈ø≈øion of our Faith, it is to be con≈øidered, that then to ≈øit, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeemely; becau≈øe it is as it were a ≈øpeaking unto God.

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did: Kneeling commonly when they prayed; and ≈øtanding, in making confe≈ø≈øion or profe≈ø≈øion. It is recorded of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> that hee and all the Congregation<note n="r" place="margin">1 King. 8.14.22.55.</note> ≈øtood, whiles hee confe≈ø≈øed or made acknowledgement of the goodne≈ø≈øe of God towards them, and ble≈ø≈øed the name of the Lord.

                  <hi>Homily of ≈øwearing, it is mo≈øt memorably ≈øaid:</hi> To the intent you ≈øhould know how great and grievous an offence again≈øt God wilfull perjury is, I will ≈øhew you what it is to take an oath before a Iudge upon a booke. Fir≈øt, when they laying their hands upon the Go≈øpell booke, doe ≈øweare truly to enquire, and to make a true pre≈øentment of things wherewith they be charged, and not to let from ≈øaying the truth and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly, for favour, love, dread or malice of any per≈øon, as God may helpe them, and the holy Contents of that booke: They mu≈øt con≈øider, that in that booke is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gods everla≈øting truth, his mo≈øt holy and eternall Word, whereby we have forgivene≈ø≈øe of our ≈øinnes, and be made inheritours of heaven, to live for ever with Gods Angels and Saints, in joy and gladne≈ø≈øe. In the Go≈øpell booke is contained al≈øo Gods terrible threats to ob≈øtinate ≈øinners, that will not amend their lives, nor beleeve the truth of Gods holy Word, and the everla≈øting pain prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in hell for Idolaters, Hypocrites, for fal≈øe and vaine ≈øwearers, for perjured men, for fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øe barers,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16242:124"/>for fal≈øe condemners of innocent and guiltle≈ø≈øe men, and for them which for favour, hide the crimes of evill doers, that they ≈øhould not be puni≈øhed. So that who≈øoever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for ≈øweare them≈øelves upon Chri≈øts holy Evangely, (or Go≈øpell) they utterly for≈øake Gods mercy, goodne≈ø≈øe, and truth, the merits of our Saviour Chri≈øts Nativity, Life, Pa≈øsion, Death, Re≈øurrection and A≈øcen≈øion, they refu≈øe the forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øinnes, promi≈øed to all penitent ≈øinners, the joyes of heaven, the companie with Angels and Saints for ever. All which benefits and comforts are promi≈øed unto true Chri≈øtian per≈øons in the Go≈øpell. And they ≈øo being for≈øworne upon the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, doe betake them≈øelves to the devills ≈øervice, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter of all lies, fal≈øhood, deceit, and perjurie, provoking the great indignation and cur≈øe of God again≈øt them in this life, and the terrible wrath and judgement of our Saviour Chri≈øt, at the great day of the la≈øt judgement, when he ≈øhall ju≈øtly judge both the quicke and the dead, according to their workes. For who≈øoever for≈øaketh the truth, for love or di≈øplea≈øure of any man, or for lucre and profit to him≈øelfe, doth for≈øake Chri≈øt, and with <hi>Iudas</hi> betray him. And although ≈øuch perjured mens fal≈øhood be now kept ≈øecret, yet it ≈øhall be opened at the la≈øt day, when the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of all mens hearts ≈øhall be manife≈øt to all the world. And then the truth ≈øhall appeare, and accu≈øe them: and their owne con≈øcience, with all the ble≈ø≈øed company of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ≈øhall beare witne≈ø≈øe truely again≈øt them. And Chri≈øt the righteous Iudge ≈øhall then ju≈øtly condemne them to everla≈øting ≈øhame and death. <hi>As in a great part of the booke intituled</hi> God and the King, <hi>we may find much divine in≈øtruction concerning taking a lawful oath, ≈øo where there is delivered the nature of an oath in generall, it is much remarkeable. It is * there ≈øaid,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:16242:125"/>An oath is a mo≈øt ≈øacred bond, and with a ≈øecret terrour imprinted by the immediate ≈øinger of God in the taking thereof, doth ≈øo ≈øtraitly oblige the inmo≈øt ≈øoule and con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that although many men bee obdurate unto other grievous ≈øinnes: yet they will be tender and ≈øen≈øible of the violation of an oath. Very often (≈øaith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine</hi>) men provoke their wives whom they ≈øu≈øpect to bee adulterous, to cleere them≈øelves by an oath, which they would not doe, unle≈ø≈øe they did beleve that tho≈øe which feare not adultery, may feare perjurie: For indeed (≈øaith hee) ≈øome uncha≈øt women which have not feared to deceive their husbands by wantonne≈ø≈øe, have beene afraid to u≈øe God unto them as a witne≈ø≈øe of their cha≈øtitie. <hi>When one layeth his hands upon the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell booke, and ≈øignifieth that according as he te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the truth, ≈øo he expecteth and de≈øireth helpe from God and the contents of that booke, he ≈øwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by, or taketh for witne≈ø≈øe the everla≈øting word of the Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, in praying for benefit by that word, according as then hee beareth witne≈ø≈øe unto the truth.

                  <hi>IN the Service of Matrimony the Duties of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed per≈øons are very Divinely delivered.

But to this prayer mu≈øt be joyned a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular diligence, whereof Saint <hi>Peter</hi> giveth this precept, ≈øaying, You<note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note> Husbands, deale with your Wives according to knowledge, giving honour to the Wife, as to the weaker Ve≈ø≈øel, &amp; as unto them that are heires al≈øo of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. This precept doth particularly pertaine to the Husband: for he ought to be the leader and author of love, in cheri≈øhing and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing

For the woman is a weake creature, not indued with like ≈øtrength &amp; con≈øtancy of minde, therfore they be the ≈øooner di≈øquieted, and they be the more prone to all weake affections and di≈øpo≈øitions of minde, more than men bee, and lighter they be, and more vaine in their fanta≈øies and opinions. The≈øe things mu≈øt bee con≈øidered of the man, that he be not too<note n="t" place="margin">Col. 3.19.</note> ≈øtiffe, ≈øo that hee ought to<note n="u" place="margin">Prov. 19.11.</note> winke at ≈øome things, and mo≈øt gently expound<note n="w" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> all things, and to<note n="x" place="margin">Eph. 4.2, 3.</note> forbeare.</p>

Prov. 5.18, 19. 1 Pet. 3.7. 1 Cor. 13.4.5.</note> beate his wife, for that is the greate≈øt ≈øhame that can be, not ≈øo much to her that is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as to him that doth the deed. Let there be none ≈øo grievous fault to compell you to beate your Wives. But what ≈øay I, your Wives? No, it is not to bee borne with, that an hone≈øt man ≈øhould lay hands on his<note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 16.6.</note> maid≈øervant to beate her. Wherefore, if it be a great ≈øhame for a man to beate his bond≈øervant, much more<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> rebuke it is, to lay violent hands upon his free woman. And this thing may be well under≈øtood by the lawes which the Panims have made, which doth di≈øcharge her any longer to dwell with ≈øuch an Husband, as unworthy to have any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company with her, that doth ≈ømite her. For it is an extreame point, thus ≈øo vilely to intreat her like a ≈ølave, that is fellow to thee of thy life, and ≈øo joyned unto thee before time, in the nece≈ø≈øary matters of thy living.

                  <hi>Homily concerning the ≈øtate of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it is ≈øaid:</hi> Shall the wife abu≈øe the gentlene≈ø≈øe and humanity of her husband? and, at her plea≈øure, turne all things<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 14.1. Ecclus. 42.6.</note> up≈øide downe? No ≈øurely. For that is farre repugnant again≈øt Gods Commandement. For thus doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preach to them, Ye wives, be ye<note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1, 2. Gen. 3.16. Tit. 2.4.5. Eph. 5.24.</note> in ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to your owne husbands. To obey, is another thing than to controule and command; which yet they may doe to their Children and family: but as for their husbands, them mu≈øt they obey, and cea≈øe from commanding, and performe ≈øubjection. For this ≈øurely doth nouri≈øh concord very much, when the wife is ready at hand at her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16242:147"/>commandement, when ≈øhee will apply her ≈øelfe to his will, when ≈øhee endeavoureth her ≈øelfe to ≈øeeke his<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.3.34.</note> contentation, and to doe him plea≈øure, when ≈øhee will e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew all things what might offend him. For thus will mo≈øt truely be verified the ≈øaying of the Poet, A good wife by obeying her husband, ≈øhall beare the rule, ≈øo that he ≈øhall have a delight and a gladne≈ø≈øe, the ≈øooner at all times to returne home unto her. But on the contrary part, when the wives be ≈øtubborne, froward, &amp; malapert, their husbands are compelled thereby to abhorre and flee from their owne hou≈øes, even as they ≈øhould have battaile with their enemies. <hi>And</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. <hi>242.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>afterward it is ≈øignified,</hi> That when wives through frailty and infirmitie have done ami≈ø≈øe, they beware that they ≈øtand not in their faults and wilfulne≈ø≈øe: but rather let them acknowledge their follies, and ≈øay, My husband, ≈øo it is, that by my anger I was compelled to doe this or that, forgive it mee, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I will take better heed. Thus ought the woman more readily to doe, the more they be ready to offend. And they ≈øhall not onely doe this to avoid ≈øtrife and debate: but rather in the re≈øpect of the Commandement of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expre≈ø≈øeth it in this forme of words, Let wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be ≈øubject to their owne<note n="k" place="margin">Eph. 5.22, 23, 24. 1 Cor. 11.3.</note> husbands as to the Lord: for the husband is the head of the woman, as Chri≈øt is the head of the Church. Here you under≈øtand, that God hath commanded, that ye ≈øhould acknowledge the authority of the husband, and referre to him the honour of obedience. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaith in that place before rehear≈øed, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.5.6.</note> Matrons did in former time decke them≈øelves, not with Gold and Silver, but in putting their whole hope in God, and in obeying their husbands, as <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him Lord, who≈øe daughters yee bee (≈øaith he) if yee follow her example.

And as that apparell is of nature ≈øo appointed, to declare her ≈øubjection: So bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that all other of her rayment ≈øhould expre≈ø≈øe both<note n="o" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.9.</note> ≈øhamefa≈øtne≈ø≈øe and ≈øobriety. For if it bee not lawfull for the woman to have her head<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.6, 14, 15.</note> bare, but to beare thereon the ≈øigne of her power, (or the power over her) where≈øoever ≈øhe goeth: more is it required that ≈øhe declare the thing that is meant thereby. <hi>In the prayer to be read after the wed with the Ring, The dutie both of man and wife is delivered,</hi> That as <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> lived faithfully together, ≈øo the≈øe per≈øons may ≈øurely performe and keepe the vow and covenant betwixt them made (whereof this Ring given and received is a token and pledge) and may ever remaine in perfect love and peace together, and live according to thy Lawes.</p>
