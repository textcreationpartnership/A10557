            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> The great authority of the Homilies may alſo appeare out of the Titles of both Tomes of them. The Title of the firſt Tome is, <hi>Certaine Sermons or Homilies appointed to bee read in Churches, in the time of the late Queene</hi> Elizabeth <hi>of famous memory And now thought fit to be reprinted by Authority from the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty.</hi> The Title of the ſecond is, <hi>The ſecond Tome of Homilies, of ſuch matters as were promiſed, and entituled in the former part of Homilies: ſet out by the Authority of the late Queenes Majeſty: and to be read in every Pariſh Church agreeably.</hi> There are no writings of any Author whatſoever, whereunto the Church aſcribeth ſo much authority, as to the Bookes of Divine Service, having ordained them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together with the holy Scriptures to bee publikely read in every congregation of the Land. Now ſome will ſay, It appeareth by theſe relatings, that great is the reſpect which we owe unto the ſaid bookes of the Church; but yet we are to receive no delivery in them, but what we know agreeth with the Word of God. In which ſaying of many of theſe times there is contained a greater defect, than all doe obſerve therein. For firſt by ſo ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:16242:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>they attribute not ſuch authority, as is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church their Mother; they duely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not her loyalty unto Chriſt her Head. S. <hi>Paul</hi> propoundeth the Church her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or faithfull obeience to be a patterne for imitation, where he ſaith: <hi>As the Church is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.24.</note> ſo let the wives bee to their owne husbands in every thing.</hi> Put caſe, that in that her fundamentall Doctrine there were ſome deliveries not in all reſpects ſo perfect as are the Scriptures of God our Father, yet it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her loving nature and prudence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto us any matter for our hurt. Yea, what we ſuppoſe to be imperfect, wee may make that uſe thereof, for which it was by her intended, and be much benefited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Secondly, by that their limitation they imply, that they have an ability to judge the underſtanding and wiſdome of their mother. And if they bee demanded, whence they have received ſo great an extraordinary abilitie, as to judge of their mother the Church her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Doctrine? The common anſwer is, by their reading the holy Scriptures: They not ſeriouſly conſidering what is written in them alſo,<note place="margin">Acts 8.30, 31.</note> That how can one reading the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:16242:8"/>Scriptures underſtand them, except ſome man guide him?<note place="margin">Malachi 2.7.</note> And that the Prieſts lips is to keepe knowledge, and the people is to ſeeke the Law at his mouth. The Clergie of the Church is to teach the common people of the ſame. The lay people in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and applying the Scriptures are to be guided by the Prieſthood or Clergy. And before it hath beene declared, that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Clergy with one mouth and conſent have borne witneſſe, <hi>That there is not any thing in the Booke of Common Prayer, which is contrary to the Word of God: And that the booke of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies doth containe a godly and wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and neceſſary for theſe times to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded of the people.</hi> Seeing then all the guides in the Church, all the ordained keepers of knowledge, all ſuch from whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are appointed to ſeeke the Law, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall inſtruction and teaching, doe teſtifie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the truth and profitableneſſe of the bookes of the Divine Service, can any one juſtly accept againſt any deliverie in them, unleſſe he doe aſſume unto, himſelfe for to outſee the whole Clergy of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath ſo greatly
<pb facs="tcp:16242:8"/>confirmed the authority of his Church, that he hath ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> Whoſo neglecteth to heare the Church, let him (or her) be unto his people as an Heathen, and a Publicane. Wherefore it is our bounden duty moſt diligently to heare, read, and meditate on every particular delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in thoſe fundamentall bookes compoſed by the perfecteſt wiſdome of the Church our mother, and to frame our mindes and lives according to every preſcription in the ſame, which doth in any wiſe concerne us. And we thus honouring the Church our ſpirituall Mother, God our heavenly Father will give us his bleſſing, <hi>Hee will ſend us light in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, readineſſe and obedience in our will, diſcretion in our words and actions, true, ſerious, and loyall indeavours,</hi>

And let none except here againſt, becauſe the deliveries are in no Philoſophicall method, but in the moſt vulgar plainnes: for all hereof is written for the furtherance of the laity; and aſwell in termes, as in forme and manner accommodated unto the meaneſt capacity. All teachers which ſtudy to edifie their auditory, doe well know, that it is farre eaſier to expreſſe their mindes in divine matters, ſo as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may comprehend, than as the unlearned may but a

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, let none expect to finde any common place of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity here fully handled; but let this worke be accounted only an introduction into the bookes of the divine Service, where, as in an Ocean of divine truth, there may bee had a great abundance of information both touching he mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters enſuing, and alſo concerning many more. This book may be uſed as a finger of one, that pointeth us unto ſuch places, as we have not throughly taken notice of afore. Alſo the godly reader ſhall perceive that every one which<note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 5.6.</note> hungreth and thriſteth after righteouſneſſe, to have within him more and more the<note n="x" place="margin">Phil. 2.5. 1 Cor. 2.16.</note> minde of Chriſt, and to have the life of Ieſus more and more made<note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.10, 11.</note> manifeſt in his body, may forth of every Chapter following receive ſome light unto the apprehending of everlaſting truth in the matter there treated on.

For how can a man haue this true faith, this ſure truſt and confidence in God, that by the merits of Chriſt his ſinnes be forgiuen, and he reconciled to the fauour of God, and to be partaker of the Kingdome of Heauen by Chriſt, when he liueth vngodly, and<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 1.16.

               <p>Surely no ſuch vngodly man can haue this faith and truſt in God. For as they know Chriſt to bee the onely Sauiour of the World: ſo they know alſo that Wicked men ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9.10.</note> not enioy the Kingdome of God.</p>

               <p>The great and mercifull benefits of God (if they be well conſidered) do neyther miniſter vnto vs occaſion to be idle, and to liue without doing any good workes, neyther yet ſtirre vs vp by any meanes to doe euill things. But contrariwiſe if we be not deſperate perſons

This is the Chriſtian faith, which theſe Holy men had, and wee alſo ought to haue. And although they were not named Chriſtian men, yet was it a Chriſtian faith that they had, for they looked for all the benefits of God the Father, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, as wee now doe. This difference is betweene them and vs, that they looked when Chriſt ſhould come, and we be in the time when hee is come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore ſayth Saint</hi> Auguſtine, the time is altered and changed, but not the Faith. For wee haue both one faith in one <hi>CHRIST.</hi> The ſame Holy Ghoſt alſo that wee haue, had they, ſayth Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> For as the Holy Ghoſt doeth teach vs to truſt in God, and to call vppon him as our Father: So did hee likewiſe inſtruct and teach them to ſay, as it is Written,<note n="*" place="margin">Eſay 63.16.</note> Thou Lord art our Father and redeemer, and thy name is without beginning, and euerlaſting.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16242:26"/>God gaue them grace to bee his Children, as hee doth vs now. But now by the comming of our Sauior Chriſt, wee haue receiued more aboundantly the Spirit of God in our hearts, whereby we may conceiue a greater faith and ſurer truſt, than many of them had. But in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they and wee be all one: Wee haue the ſame faith that they had in God, and they the ſame that we haue. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much extolleth their faith, becauſe we ſhould no leſſe, but rather more, giue our ſelues wholly vnto Chriſt, both in profeſſion and liuing, now when Chriſt is come, than the olde Fathers did before his comming.</p>
               <p>And by all the declaration of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that the true, liuely, and Chriſtian faith, is no dead, vaine, or vnfruitfull thing, but a thing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vertue, of wonderfull Operation or working, and ſtrength, bringing foorth all good motions, and good Workes.</p>

                  <hi>vniuerſally for all men, it behooueth vs to deſcend into the bottome of our conſcience, and deeply to conſider the firſt and principall cauſes, wherefore hee was compelled ſo to doe.

                  <hi>fulneſſe of time was come, that is, the perfection and courſe of yeares, appointed from the beginning, then God according to his former couenant and promiſe, ſent a Meſsias, otherwiſe called a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, into the world; not ſuch a one as</hi> Moſes <hi>was, not ſuch a one as</hi> Ioſhua, Saul <hi>or</hi> Dauid <hi>was: but ſuch a one as ſhould deliuer mankind from the bitter curſe of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16242:36"/>Law, and make perfect ſatisfaction by his death, for the ſinnes of all people; namely he ſent his deere and onely Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, borne (as the Apoſtle ſaith) of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and made vnder the law, that he might</hi>

                  <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them that were in bondage of the law, and make them the children of God by adoption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the neceſſity of Chriſts death, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declareth to the Hebrewes ſaying:<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 9.15.16.17.18 23.</note> And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by meanes of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were vnder the firſt Teſtament, they which are called, might receiue the promiſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall inheritance. For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtatour. For a Teſtament is of force after men be dead: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is of no ſtrength at all whileſt the Teſtatour liueth. Whereupon neither the firſt teſtament was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated without bloud. It was therefore neceſſary that the patternes of things in the heauens ſhould be purified with theſe, but the heauenly things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with better ſacrifices than theſe.</p>
               <p>And in another place the ſame Apoſtle ſayth:<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 2.9.10.</note> We ſee Ieſus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for euery man. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſonnes vnto glory, to make the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their ſaluation perfect through ſufferings. For as much then as the children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him, that had the power of death, that is, the diuell.

               <p>An Archbiſhop therefore in the ſeruice of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating is called, <hi>Moſt Reuerend Father in God:</hi> vnto whom, euery Biſhop conſecrated to Dioceſſe within his Prouince, profeſſeth and promiſeth by oath all due reuerence and obedience; like as euery Prieſt doth vnto the Biſhop, within whoſe Dioceſſe he is Paſtour.</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch an order among the Biſhops is of Diuine ordinance, it is euident from that, the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named Biſhops in the Primitiue Chriſtian Church,<note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 1.6.</note>

               <p>But ſome there are which ſay that ſuch diſtinction was not by Chriſt or dained to continue in his Church: but onely was appointed in the primitiue ſtate thereof, whiles Churches were in planting, and is now long agoe quite ceaſed. The which affirmation is no where deliuered in Holy Scripture, nor intimated; neither from any ſentence therein can be truly concluded.</p>
               <p>But the direct contrary Doctrine is deliuered by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Epheſians, and that in moſt expreſſe manner.

               </p>
               <p>The which deliuery of the Apoſtle declareth moſt

               <p>It is alſo here to be noted that the name Apoſtle vſed in the new Teſtament, doth imply two degrees. Whence it is thought meete to tranſlate it ſometimes by the word<note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 2.25. 2. Cor 8.23.1. 2. Cor. 11.5. Gal. 2.9.</note> meſſenger.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is in Scripture mention of the chiefeſt Apoſtles, it implyeth that there was ſome diſparity among the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And what degree or order is that inferiour, if it be not that<note n="w" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.5.</note> Euangeliſtſhip, which is aboue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorſhip,

               <p>Truely therefore and properly in the Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice are Biſhops ſignified to be the Apoſtles of Chriſts Church, as where it is ſayd in the Seruice of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: <hi>We make our humble ſupplications vnto thee for theſe children, vpon whom (after the example of the holy Apoſtles) we haue laide our hands, to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them (by this ſigne) of thy fauour and gracious goodneſſe toward them.</hi>

               <p>WHereas the Church, both in the prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordering of Prieſts, and alſo in the prayer afore the conſecrating of Biſhops, mentioneth, <hi>That Chriſt hath giuen Prophets to his Church,</hi> together with the diuerſe orders of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Miniſtery; it is neceſſary to conſider what kind of prophetſhip that is. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians:<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.3.</note> He that propheſieth, ſpeaketh vnto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
               <p>Inſteed of which propheſying then ordinarily v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church of Corinth, there is now vſed the exerciſe called Preaching. And therefore, becauſe preaching now is to the ſame effect, as the ordinary prophecying then in the congregation was, therefore the word for prophecying is ſomtimes rendred<note n="*" place="margin">As in the margent of the Geneua Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of 1.

               <p>In the writings of the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles, there is nomention that Prophets were made by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but all whom it is ſayd the Church did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, were either to ſerue as Apoſtles, or Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, or Elders, or as Deacons.</p>
               <p>It is written that there hath beene times when no Prophet was in the Church; As in the Booke of the Pſalmes it is ſayd:<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 74.9.</note> We ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there among vs any, that knoweth how long.

               <p>The principall Prophets, or ſuch as were endued with the meaſure of grace, which for the dignity thereof, obtained the greateſt account next vnto thoſe of the higheſt degree in the Miniſtery of the Church, ſeeme to be men of a ſingular diuine vnderſtanding,<note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 1.9 10.</note> raiſed vp of God for<note n="p" place="margin">Hag. 1.1.2.</note> ſpirituall occaſions in ſpeciall times.</p>

               <p>In the<note n="*" place="margin">T. 2. p. 138.</note> Homily of Common Prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is ſayd: <hi>That</hi> Baſilius Magnus, <hi>and</hi> Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Chryſoſtomus <hi>did in their time preſcribe publike orders of publike adminiſtration, which they call Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; and in them they appointed the people to anſwere vnto the prayer of the Miniſter, ſometime, Amen; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, Lord haue mercy vpon vs, ſometime, And with thy Spirit, and We haue our hearts lifted vp vnto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">To. 2. p. 134.</note> Homily, it is alſo ſayd: <hi>By the hiſtories of the Bible it appeareth, that publike and common Prayer is moſt auaileable before God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is much to be lamented, that it is no better</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Euen ſhortly after that the Diuine Seruice was ſet foorth, the Diuell wrought in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people a more and more neglecting of it.</note>

               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid in the Preface before the Common Prayer, <hi>That the firſt original and ground of the diuine Seruice, of a man would ſearch out by the ancient Fathers, he ſhall finde that the ſame was not ordained, but of a good purpoſe, and for a great aduancement of godlineſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd vnto <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">1. Tim. 2.1.2.3</note> I exhort that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giuing of thankes be made for all men: for Kings, and for all

For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. <hi>Moſes</hi> from the Lord preſcribed vnto <hi>Aaron</hi> and vnto his ſonnes a forme of bleſſing the people, ſaying:<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 6.23.24.25.26.</note> On this wiſe yee ſhall bleſſe the children of Iſrael, ſaying vnto them: The Lord bleſſe thee, and keepe the: The Lord make his face ſhine vpon thee, and be gracious vnto thee: The Lord lift vp his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vpon thee, and giue thee peace.</p>
               <p>It is very conſiderable hereto, that which is written of King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the booke of Chronicles, That he and the Princes commanded the Leuites to ſing praiſe vnto the Lord,<note n="l" place="margin">2.

               <p>IN the Treatiſe of Ceremonies, why ſome be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and ſome retained, ſet afore the Common Prayer, it is ſaid: <hi>Of ſuch Ceremonies as bee uſed in the Church, and have had their beginning by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of man; ſome at the firſt were of Godly intent and purpoſe deviſed, &amp;c. Other there bee, which although they have beene deviſed by man, yet it is thought good to reſerve them ſtill, as wel for a decent order in the Church, (for the which they were firſt deviſed) as becauſe they appertaine unto</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31. and 14.12, Rom. 14.19.</note> 
                  <hi>edification, whereunto all things done in the Church (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ought to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. And although the keeping, or omitting of a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie in it ſelfe conſidered, is but a ſmall thing: Yet the wilfull and contemptuous tranſgreſsion and breaking of a common order and diſcipline, is no ſmall offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40.</note> 
                  <hi>Let all things be done among you</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Saint Paul) <hi>in a ſeemely and due order. The appointment of the which order pertaineth not to</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the ſaid Preface it is afterward ſaid: <hi>Chriſts Religion is content onely with thoſe Ceremonies, which doe ſerve to a decent order, and Godly diſcipline; and ſuch as bee apt to ſtirre up the dull minde of man to the</hi>

And if they thinke much that any of the old remaine, and would rather have all deviſed anew: then ſuch men granting ſome Ceremonies convenient to bee had, ſurely where the old may bee well uſed, there they cannot reaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove the old, onely for their age, without bewraying their owne folly. For in ſuch a caſe, they ought rather to have reverence unto them for their antiquity, if they will declare themſelves to be more ſtudious of</hi>

                  <hi>Homily of Common prayer and Sacraments it is ſaid:</hi> In the Scriptures wee read of three ſorts of prayers, whereof two are private, and the third is common. The firſt is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaying:<note n="g" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> I will that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without wrath or ſtriving. And it is the devout lifting up of the mind to God without the uttering of the hearts griefe or deſire by open voice. So<note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Anna</hi> prayed. After this ſort muſt all Chriſtians pray, not once in a weeke, or once in a day onely: but as S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Theſ. 5.17.</note> without ceaſing. And S. <hi>Iames</hi> writeth,<note n="k" place="margin">Iam. 5.16.17</note> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer of a juſt man is of much force. The ſecond ſort of prayer is ſpoken in the Goſpell of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where it is ſaid:<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 6.6.</note> When thou prayeſt, enter into thy ſecret cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut the doore to thee, pray to thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16242:69"/>in ſecret, and thy father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee. So<note n="m" place="margin">Acts 10.2.</note> Cornelius prayed. Theſe be the two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſorts of prayer, the one mentall, that is to ſay, the devout lifting up of the minde to God: and the other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, that is to ſay, the ſecret uttering of the griefes and deſires of the heart with words, but yet in a ſecret cloſet, or ſome ſolitary place.

               <p>IN the Preface afore the Common prayer it is ſaid: <hi>The ancient fathers for a great advancement of godlineſſe ſo ordered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greateſt part thereof) ſhould be read over once every yeare, intending thereby that the Clergy, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as were Miniſters of the Congregation, ſhould (by often reading and meditation of Gods Word) be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to godlineſſe themſelves, and be more able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort others by wholeſome doctrine, and to confute them that were adverſaries to the truth. And further that the people (by dayly hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) ſhould continually profit more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inflamed with the love of his true religion.</hi> What care hereto our fathers have had, may appeare out of the <hi>ſacred Kalender,</hi> and out of the order how the Pſalter is appointed to be read, and out of the <hi>order</hi> how the reſt of the holy Scripture (beſide the Pſalter) is appointed to be read; all which are ſet before the Common prayer.</p>
               <p>It is recorded in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, that at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> in the Synagogue on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, there was the<note n="ſ" place="margin">Act. 13.15.</note> reading of the Law and the Prophets.

                  <note place="margin">Of reading the Homilies.</note>Concerning reading the Homilies the Sermons ſet forth by the publike authoritie of the Church, in the Preface publiſhed afore them it is ſaid: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how neceſſary it is that the Word of God, which is the onely food of the ſoule, and that moſt excellent light that we muſt walke by, in this our moſt dangerous pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, at all convenient times be preached unto the people, that thereby they may both learne their duty towards God, their Prince, and their neighbours, according to the minde of the Holy Ghoſt, expreſſed in the Scriptures: and alſo to avoide the manifold enormities which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by falſe doctrine have crept into the Church of God: and how that all they which are appointed Miniſters, have not the gift of preaching ſufficiently to inſtruct the people, which is committed unto them, whereof great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences might riſe, and ignorance ſtill be maintained, if ſome honeſt remedy be not ſpeedily found and provided. The Queenes moſt excellent Majeſtie, tendering the ſole health of her loving ſubjects, &amp; the quieting of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in the chiefe &amp; principall points of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and willing alſo by the true ſetting forth, and pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of Gods Word, which is the principal guide &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der runto all godlines and vertue, to expell &amp; drive away as well all corrupt, vicious, and ungodly living, as alſo erroneous and poyſoned doctrines, tending to ſuperſtition and Idolatry: hath by the adviſe of her moſt honourable Counſellors, for her diſcharge in this behalfe, cauſed a booke of Homilies, which heretofore was ſet forth by her moſt loving brother, a Prince of moſt worthy memorie,</hi> Edward the ſixt, <hi>to bee printed anew, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16242:73"/>certaine wholeſome and godly exhortations, to move the people to honour and worſhip Almighty God, and diligently to ſerve him, every one according to their degree, ſtate, &amp; vocation.</hi> And in the latter part of the Preface it is ſaid: <hi>That all her people, of what degree or condition ſoever they be, may learne how to invocate, and call upon the name of God, and know what duty they owe both to God and man: ſo that they may pray, beleeve, and worke according to knowledge, while they ſhall live here, and after this life bee with him that with his blood hath bought us all.</hi> And at the end of the firſt Tome of the Homilies it is ſaid concerning the Homilies of the ſecond Tome, <hi>Hereafter ſhall follow ſermons of faſting, praying, almeſdeeds, &amp;c. with many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well fruitfull as necèſſarie to the edifying of Chriſtian people, and the increaſe of godly living.</hi> From al which aforeſaid delivery it is moſt manifeſt, that the one only end, why the reverend Fathers, and the moſt learned Doctors of the Church compoſed the ſermons commonly called Homilies, was for the edification of the congregations in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe; and for a helpe unto Miniſters, that with the ſaid ſacred ſermons the people committed to their charge might be the more inſtructed in the faith and life of the true Chriſtian religion. As therefore we have received from our fathers the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer, as a forme of prayer, thankſgiving, and confeſſion: ſo ought wee not to receive from our fathers hands their booke of Sermons the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as a forme of wholeſome words, in faith and love which is in Chriſt Ieſus? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> charged <hi>Timothy</hi> to hold faſt the<note n="w" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.13. Rom. 6.17.</note> forme of ſound words, which he had heard of him, in faith and love, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16242:74"/>is in Chriſt Ieſus. Let any one unpartially weigh every particular ſentence in the booke of Homilies, and there will appeare nothing but Chriſtian faith and godly love intended and held forth therein.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ought wee reverently to heare the Sermons of ſuch as bee but young Students in Divinity? and ought we not with great reverence to attend unto the Homilies the Sermons ſet forth by the chiefeſt Divines in the whole Church of our Land?<note place="margin">We ought not to be partiall towards the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church.</note> We commonly aſcribe great authoritie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirit of the Church, accounting her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer profitable for us to pray with unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: We aſcribe great authoritie unto the ſpirit of the Church, accounting her tranſlation of the Scriptures into our mother tongue to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and meet for vs both to heare and read, yea and to ſettle our beliefe therein; and ought we not alſo to aſcribe great authoritie unto the ſpirit of the Church, in her<note n="x" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.20.</note> prophecying or ſermon making, her compoſing of the Homilies for our inſtruction in the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures? Wee pray unto God as her wiſedome hath preſcribed; we heare and read for holy Scripture, as her wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath tranſlated; and ought we not with like conſcionable reſpect to heare and read the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, interpretations, applications, &amp;c. in her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies ſet forth for Doctrine, refutation, correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, as her wiſdome hath delivered unto us? The great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the deliveries in the Homilies may appeare unto us out of this conſideration; When wee heare a Paſtour, Curate, or Lecturer preach, wee heare
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16242:74"/>deliveries which are but the wiſdome of a private Miniſter: But when wee heare a Homily read, wee heare deliveries, which are the wiſdome of the Church, or for approbation whereof the whole Churches Clergie have written their<note n="*" place="margin">See the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.

               <p>Concerning exhortation in publike, it is ſaid in the Rubricke after the Nicene Creed: <hi>After ſuch ſermon, homily, or exhortation, the Curate ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the people, whether there be any holy-dayes, or faſting dayes the weeke following, and earneſtly exhort them to remember the poore, ſaying one or moe of theſe ſentences following, as hee thinketh moſt convenient by his diſcretion.</hi>

For (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) the knowledge of holy Scripture, is a great, large, and a high place; but the doore is very low, ſo that the high and<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 11.25, 26.

For humility will only ſearch to know the truth, it will ſearch, and bring together one place with another; and where it cannot finde out the meaning, it will pray, it will<note n="w" place="margin">Acts 8.34.</note> aske of other that know, and will not preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and raſhly define any thing, which it knoweth not.

And concerning the hardneſſe of the Scripture, he that is ſo weake that he is not able to brooke ſtrong<note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 5.12, 13, 14. 1 Cor. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> meat, yet he may ſucke the ſweete and tender milke, and deferre the reſt untill he waxe ſtronger, and come to more knowledge.

And the Scripture is full as well of low valleyes, plaine wayes, and eaſie for every man to uſe, and to walke in: as alſo of high hits and mountaines, which few men can climbe unto. And whoſoever giveth his minde to holy Scriptures, with diligent ſtudy, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſire, it cannot bee (ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) that he ſhould be<note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 25.12, 13 Iſa. 50.10.</note> left without helpe.

And wherein is our communication? not in the commendation of vertuous and good deeds, of hoſpitality, of love between Chriſtian brother and brother, of love betweene man and wife, of virginity and chaſtity, and of Almes toward the poore. Not in Pſalmes and godly ſongs, not in lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for our ſinnes, not in repreſsing the affections of the body, not in prayers to God. We talke of Scripture, but in the meane time we ſubdue not our fleſh by faſting, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and weeping: wee make not this life a meditation of death, we doe not ſtrive to be lords ouer our appetites and affections. We goe not about to pull downe our proud and high minds, to abate our fumiſh and rancorous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, to reſtraine our luſts and bodily delectations, our undiſcreet ſorrowes, our laſcivious mirth, ovr inordinate looking, our unſatiable hearing of vanities, our ſpeaking without meaſure, our inconvenient thoughts; and briefly, to reforme our life and manners: but all our holineſſe conſiſteth in talking. And we pardon each other from all good living, ſo that we may ſticke faſt together in argumentation, as though there were no more wayes to heaven but this alone, the way of ſpeculation and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16242:84"/>(as they take it.) But in very deed it is rather the way of ſuperfluous contention and ſophiſtication. The ſame Author ſaith alſo in another place; That the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Chriſtian man ought to begin of the feare of God, and to end in matters of high ſpeculation: and not contrarily to begin with ſpeculation and to end in feare. For ſpeculation <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> either high cunning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if it be not ſtayed with the bridle of feare to offend God, is dangerous, and enough to tumble a man headlong downe the hill. Therefore ſaith he: The feare of God muſt be the firſt beginning, and as it were an <hi>A. B. C.</hi> or an introduction to all them that ſhall enter into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true and moſt fruitfull knowledge of holy Scriptures. Where as is the feare of God, there is (ſaith he) the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandements: and where as is the keeping of the Commandements, there is the cleanſing of the fleſh: which fleſh is a cloud before the ſoules eye, and ſuffereth it not purely to ſee the beame of the heavenly light. Where as is the cleanſing of the fleſh, there is the illumination of the holy Ghoſt, the end of all our deſires, and the very light whereby the verity of Scriptures is ſeene and perceived.</p>

Among the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, which are in the common prayer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read for to ſtir up people to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the poore, there are inſerted three verſes out of the booke of <hi>Tobias.</hi> In both Tomes of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the Church with great reſpect hath alledged very many ſayings out of the bookes called <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> aſcribing greater authority to them than unto meere humane writings. In the margent of the laſt tranſlation of the Bible, there is often reference made unto Chapter and verſe of thoſe bookes: as in the margent of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. and in more places. There is no ſuch reference made unto Chapter and verſe of any other bookes, excepting the canonicall Scriptures. In the <hi>Concordance</hi> (which is ſometimes bound with bibles of the middle bigneſſe, namely <hi>in quarto</hi>) places out of all thoſe bookes are often quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16242:85"/>and added unto the places cited out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures. It is not ſo done out of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes. Even all the Fathers, which have lived in the Church of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſince firſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes, have with great reverence and reſpect alleaged ſayings out of thoſe books. The true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Church of <hi>England</hi> hath ordained thoſe bookes onely, and none other of what authoritie ſoever, to be tranſlated with the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to be ſet betweene the bookes of the old and new Teſtament. Seeing then that the Church our mother ſo honoureth the ſaid bookes called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> ought not wee her members to have them bound in our Bibles, to reverence and reſpect them, and diligently to read them for<note n="*" place="margin">The Church in the ſixt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of religion ſo delivereth.</note> example of life and inſtruction of manners, and to account them for to be in all reſpects of ſo much<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4.8. 1 Theſ. 5.21. 1 Pet. 5.5.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16242:85"/>ſacred Catechiſme conſiſteth of but about twenty queſtions, whoſe anſwers require any labour of learning by heart. And yet therein is contained the ſumme of the whole Chriſtian faith and life, in a moſt Divine delivery. This holy<note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 119.130.</note> Catechiſme ſhould all people members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have either in memory; or elſe at leaſt be able ſo to<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.13.</note> anſwere unto each queſtion therein, as that they may declare themſelves to have in effect ſuch an<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 3.16. 1 Cor. 1.10.</note> underſtanding of the matters therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the Church hath in full words expreſſed in it.</p>
               <p>Catechiſme is an inſtructing of people in the<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note> principles of the Oracles of God: It is a<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 6.1, 2.</note> laying of the foundation of repentance from dead workes, and of faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, and of laying on of hands, and of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, and of the eternall judgment: It is a miniſtring of the<note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> ſincere milke of the Word unto the<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 5.13.</note> unskilfull in the word of righteouſneſſe. Even as a houſe cannot bee well built up, and ſtand faſt, unleſſe the foundations thereof be firmely laid: ſo people who ſhould bee built up a ſpirituall<note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.4.</note> houſe for an<note n="k" place="margin">Eph. 2.21, 22.</note> habitation of God through the ſpirit, cannot be fitly framed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and grow unto an holy Temple in the Lord, unleſſe they bee<note n="l" place="margin">Luke 11.52 Mat. 14.11.</note> rightly inſtructed in the principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and withall grow up in all due<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 1.5. and 16.26.</note> obedience unto the ſame. Not onely the Catechiſme in the Divine Service doth deliver the Milke of the Goſpell; but alſo the whole Divine Service doth miniſter the ſame abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:16242:86"/>
               <p>If one would know what is repentance and faith, let him reade the Homilies thereof: If hee would know what is the myſterie of baptiſme, and of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, let him reade the Services thereof: If one would know the myſterie of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let him read the Service and the Homily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It is a main part of the uſe of the Divine Service, to lay firmly in peoples mindes, the<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.10.</note> grounds of Chriſtianity. All people therefore that would bee rightly grounded in the true Chriſtian religion, and grow more and more towards<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 6.1. Col. 1.28, 29.</note> perfection in Ieſus Chriſt, ought to be much converſant in every part of the ſaid Service, and to enable themſelves ſo to render a reaſon of every point of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according as they finde it delivered in the ſaid<note n="p" place="margin">Prov. 6.20, 21, 22, 23.

                  <hi>CHAP. 54.</hi> Of Comfirmation, commonly called Biſhopping.</head>
               <p>THe order of confirmation, ſet afore the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme in the divine ſervice, giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reaſon of the ſame, in the three conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions delivered, for the which unto none confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16242:90"/>is to be miniſtred, ſave only unto ſuch, as can ſay that Catechiſme, <hi>viz. Firſt, becauſe that when children come to the yeares of diſcretion, and have learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promiſed for them in Baptiſme, they may then themſelves with their owne mouth, and with their owne conſent, openly before the Church, ratiſie and confirme the ſame: And alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by the grace of God, they will evermore endeavour themſelves faithfully to obſerve and keepe ſuch things, as they by their owne mouth and confeſsion have aſſented unto. Secondly, foraſmuch as Confirmation is miniſtred to them that be baptized, that by impoſition of hands and prayer, they may receive ſtrength and defence againſt all temptations to ſinne, and the aſſaults of the world and the Devill, it is moſt meet to bee miniſtred when children come to that age, that partly by the frailty of their owne fleſh, partly by the aſſaults of the world and the Devill, they begin to bee in danger to fall into ſundry kindes of ſinne. Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the uſage of the Church in times paſt: Whereby it was ordained that confirmation ſhould bee miniſtred to them that were of perfect age, that they being inſtructed in Chriſts religion, ſhould openly profeſſe their owne faith, and promiſe to bee obedient to the will of God.</hi> In the prayer to be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the act of confirmation, there are mentioned together the ſundry<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 24.</note> graces, wherein we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for to be confirmed, where it is ſaid: <hi>ſtrengthen them, wee beſeech thee, O Lord, with the holy Ghoſt the comforter, and daily increaſe in them thy manifold gifts of grace, the ſpirit of wiſedom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of Counſell and ghoſtly ſtrength, the ſpirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and true godlineſſe, and fulſill them (O Lord) with the ſpirit of thy holy feare.</hi> And the words of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16242:91"/>firmation or Biſhopping it ſelfe are pronuonced by the Biſhop laying his hand upon every child ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſaying: <hi>Defend, O Lord, this child with thy heauenly grace, that hee may continue thine for ever, and daily increaſe in thy holy ſpirit more and more, untill hee come unto thine everlaſting kingdome.</hi> And the reaſon of the laying the hands is delivered in the prayer to bee ſaid when Confirmation is done, where it is ſaid: <hi>Wee make our humble ſupplications unto thee for theſe children, upon whom (after the example of the holy Apoſtles) wee have laid our hands, to certifie them (by this ſigne) of thy favour and gratious goodneſſe toward them: Let thy fatherly hand, we beſeech thee, ever bee over them: Let thy holy ſpirit ever bee with them, and ſo lead them in the knowledge and obedience of thy word, that in the end they may obtaine the everlaſting life throughour Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Alſo in the rubricke at the end of the Catechiſme, it is ſaid, <hi>every Child ſhall bee brought to the Biſhop, by one that ſhall be his Godfather or Godmother, that every child may have a witneſſe of his Confirmation.</hi> Holy Church in her Lawes called Conſtitutions &amp; Canons Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hath two Canons concerning Confirmation: the<note n="*" place="margin">Canon 60.</note> one, <hi>that it is to bee performed once in three yeares:</hi> the<note n="*" place="margin">Canon 61.</note> other, <hi>that miniſters are to prepare Children for Confirmation.</hi> In the ſixtieth Canon it is ſaid: <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it hath beene a ſolemne, ancient, and laudable cuſtom in the Church of God, continued from the Apoſtles times, that all Biſhops ſhould lay their hands, upon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized and inſtructed in the Catechiſme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, praying over them, and bleſsing them, which wee commonly call Confirmation, and that this holy action hath beene accuſtomed in the Church in the former
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16242:91"/>ages, to be performed in the Biſhops viſitation every third yeere, &amp;c.</hi> Confirmation or laying on of hands is an ordinance of the Goſpel of ſo great importance, as that by the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes it is ſet as the fourth principle of the doctrine of Chriſt, where he reckoneth up together the ſixe principles of the Oracles of God, ſaying;<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 6, 1, 2.</note> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us goe on unto perfection, not laying againe the foundation, of repentance from dead workes, and of faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of the doctrine of baptiſmes, and of laying on of hands, and of the reſurrection of the dead, and of the eternall judgement. It is written in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that ſundry whom the Deacon <hi>Philip</hi> had baptized and inſtructed in the Chriſtian faith, had Confirmation or<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 8.17.</note> laying on of hands from the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſo received the holy Ghoſt. It is alſo recorded that <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 19.6.</note> laid his hands upon ſome perſons afore baptized, and they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Ghoſt.

               <p>IN the holy Catechiſme it is delivered concerning the Sacrament of Lords Supper, <hi>That it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the continuall remembrance of the ſacrifice of the death of Chriſt, and the benefits which we receive therby. The outward part or ſigne of the Lords ſupper is bread and wine, which the Lord hath commanded to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The inward part or thing ſignified, is the body and blood of Chriſt, which are verily and indeed taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the faithfull in the Lords Supper. The benefits whereof we are partakers thereby, is the ſtrengthening and refreſhing of our ſoules by the body and blood of Chriſt, as our bodies are by the bread and wine.</hi> The myſtery of this Sacrament is moſt divinely declared in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Communion. In the ſecond Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there it is ſaid; <hi>Our heavenly Father hath given his Sonne our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, not only to dye for us, but alſo to be our ſpirituall food</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>IT is ſaid in the third Exhortation to be read afore the Communion;</hi> The danger is great, if we receive the holy Sacrament unworthily, for then we bee guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt our Saviour: wee eate and drinke our owne damnation, not conſidering the Lords body: we kindle Gods wrath againſt us: wee provoke him to<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.30.</note> plague us with diuers diſeaſes, and ſundry kindes of death. Therefore if any of you be a blaſphemer of God, an hinderer or<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note> ſlanderer of his Word, an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or be in<note n="m" place="margin">1 Iohn 3.15 Mat. 5.23, 24, 25.</note> malice, or envy, or in any other griveous crime, bewaile your ſinnes, &amp;c.

Amend your lives, and be in perfect charitie with all men, ſo ſhall yee be meet partakers of thoſe holy myſteries. <hi>Therefore it is to be ſaid unto them that come to receive the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in the laſt words of exhortation, afore the generall Confeſſion be made:</hi> You that doe truly and earneſtly repent you or your ſinnes, and be in love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with your neighbours, and intend to lead a new life, following the Commandements of God, and walking from henceforth in his holy wayes: draw neare, and take this holy Sacrament to your comfort.</p>
               <p>

That is: firſt a right and worthy eſtimation and underſtanding of this myſterie. Secondly, to come in a ſure faith.

For which cauſe our Mother the Church (whoſe godly wiſedome wee ought to obey in<note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 5.24.</note> every particular matter) knowing that the new Law commandeth Chriſtians, in every thing to<note n="k" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.18.</note> give thankes, hath accounted it righteous before God, that women for ſo great a deliverance, as from the danger of child-birth, ſhould ſo ſoone as is convenient, come to the Temple of the Lord, and there with him who is to bee her mouth unto the Lord,<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 13.15.</note> offer the ſacrifice of praiſe unto God, the fruit of her lips, giving thankes unto his name.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16242:103"/>he may receive comfort, and the benefit of abſolution, to the quieting of his conſcience, and avoyding of all ſcruple and doubtfulneſſe.</hi> In the Rubricke of the Service for the Viſitation of the Sicke, it is ſaid; <hi>The ſicke perſon ſhall make a ſpeciall confeſsion, if he feele his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience troubled with any weighty matter.

For this viſible ſigne (I meane laying on of hands) is not expreſly commanded in the new Teſtament to bee uſed in abſolution, as the viſible ſignes in baptiſme and the Lords Supper are: and therfore abſolution is no ſuch Sacrament

Foraſmuch as the Lord knew how his lawes given from his eternall wiſdome and delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> would be by many ſlighted, yea nothing at all regarded, therefore ſaid the Lord Ieſus, Thinke not that I am come to<note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 5.17, 18, 19.</note> deſtroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfill.

               </head>
               <p>IN the beginning of the Service of Commination, it is ſaid: <hi>Brethren, in the Primitive Church there was a godly diſcipline, that at the beginning of Lent, ſuch perſons as were notorious offenders, were put to open penance, and puniſhed in this world, that their ſoules might be ſaved in the day of the Lord: and that others admoniſhed by their example, might be the more afraid to offend.

               <p>In the Service for Conſecration of Biſhops, it is ſaid by the Archbiſhop unto the Elected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: <hi>Will you maintaine and ſet forward (as much as ſhall lie in you) quietneſſe, peace, and love among all men? and ſuch as be unquiet, diſobedient, and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous within you Dioceſſe correct and puniſh according to ſuch authority as ye have by Gods Word, &amp; as to you ſhall be committed by the Ordinance of this Realme?</hi> Out of which delivery it appeareth that the Superiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery hath power for to cauſe tranſgreſſors for to doe penance, or to undergoe penalties. And did not the Royall Majeſty, and the Law of this Realme moſt graciouſly grant ſuch authority unto the Clergy, the <hi>licentiouſneſſe</hi> of theſe times conſidered, (as the 113.

                  <hi>Peace be to this houſe, and to all that dwell in it. And that when he commeth into the ſicke mans preſence, hee ſhall ſay kneeling down, Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber not Lord our iniquities, &amp;c.</hi> Then there is preſcribed a very Divine Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation divided into two parts, wherewith the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is to exhort the ſicke perſon; the which is moſt profitable for all people to meditate on, when they feele themſelves ill at eaſe, or in any adverſitie. And the Exhortation being read, <hi>the Miniſter is to examine whether he continueth in beliefe of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian faith, and whether he be in charity with all the world, &amp;c. And to exhort him for to ſet his ſtate in order: (whereto men, when they be in health, ſhould be oft admoniſhed) and earneſtly to move him to liberalitie toward the poore,</hi> becauſe it is the laſt Almes that ever hee ſhall give.</p>
               <p>The Church hath ordained an Homily, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation againſt the feare of death to be read unto the people. And if the ſicke perſon can well indure to heare the reading of it, he may be much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſame. The viſitation of the ſicke is one of the<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 25.35.26.</note> ſixe duties of Charitie, whereof Ieſus Chriſt will ſpeake when he ſitteth to judge all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:16242:107"/>in his Epiſtle plainely expreſſeth. It is the laſt kindneſſe, that one can ſhew unto another, whiles being is in earthly Tabernacle. Man being in that miſery deſireth to be viſited. And one reaſon is, that thereby hee hopeth either bodily or ghoſtly to receive the more comfort.

It is the duty of the ſick to ſend for their Miniſter: as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, Let him<note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 5.14.</note> ſend for the Elders of the Church.

               <p>Our Mother the Church, who, according to her godly wiſedome, was the firſt cauſer of Temples to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16242:108"/>be built in this Land, and the firſt appointer of the Pariſhes unto them, hath ordained the Temples to be the ordinary places for receiving the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But in caſes of neceſſitie, when people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any conveniency come or be brought into the Temple, her Divine Wiſdome hath appointed ſuch to receive in their private houſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>VVHereas I am daily advertiſed by the relations of many honeſt and Religious perſons, of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall misbehaviour in moſt Churches, in, and about the Citie of London, in time of Divine Service; Men and Boyes ſitting then covered with their Hats on their heads, without all ſhew of reverence or reſpect, either of that holy place or action, the one being the houſe of Almighty God, the other a continued viciſsitude (as it were) of ſpeech betweene God and his people. The due conſideration whereof might eaſily induce any well diſpoſed Chriſtian, to uſe ſuch outward Poſture and geſture of his body as becommeth that ſacred place, and the great Majeſtie of that God, to whom they come at that time profeſſedly to performe a divine worſhip. I have therefore thought it my duty, inſtantly to recommend to you the Miniſters, Church-wardens, and Side-men, the reformation of this profane abuſe, ſcandalous to our Religion, againſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Law in that caſe provided, and condemned by the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16242:111"/>contrary practice of all Chriſtians in all ages, in their like ſolemnities and aſſemblies; praying and requiring you to joyne together your utmoſt and beſt endeavours to effect the ſame, for which purpoſe it ſhall bee neceſſary for you the Church-wardens and Side-men, during the time of Divine Service, diligently to looke about the Church, and where you ſee any covered, if Boyes, or of the younger ſort, theſe to ſhame openly by pulling off their Hats, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice with ſuch diſcipline, as you have been laudably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to inflict upon ſuch rude and unmannerly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. If of the elder or better ſort (though I well hope that none of that condition out of their owne judgement will hereafter offend in this kinde) thoſe to admoniſh gravely of their duety, repreſenting unto them the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of this their ill example, and how directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant it is to the Apoſtles rule of decency in the Church, thus to celebrate Diuine Seruice, and to performe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and Religious worſhip of Almighty God. After which your admonition, if any ſhall obſtinately refuſe to uncover his or their heads in Service time, you ſhall then preſent them to mee or my Chancellour, to the end, that they by the ſeverity of cenſures may bee amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by whom brotherly and gentle perſwaſions have beene contemned. Moreover alſo, I am certainely infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the publike Service of Almighty God in the Churches is much omitted, and thereby come to neglect, and almoſt ſcorned, foraſmuch as the Miniſters reade not Divine Service, the firſt and ſecond ſervice, before their Sermons, according to the order of our Church Liturgie, and the Canon in that caſe provided: I doe therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by require all the Parſons, Vicars, and Curates in my Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, to take care that they offend not in this kinde, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly likewiſe requiring you the Church-wardens and Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16242:111"/>that according to your oathes, you preſent to me or my Chancelour, thoſe Miniſters, that ſhall be faulty in this kind, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law of the Lord is: Yee ſhall keepe my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and<note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 19.30,</note> reverence my Sanctuary.

The Lord by his Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> complaineth that reverence is not done unto him, ſaying: A ſon honoureth his Father, and a ſervant his Maſter. If then I be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where is mine<note n="h" place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> honour? And if I bee a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, where is my feare, ſaith the Lord? <hi>David</hi> therefore ſaith: Serve the Lord in feare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce unto him with<note n="i" place="margin">Pſ. 2.11. as in the divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> I would have you know, that the head of every man is Chriſt: and the head of woman is the man: and the head of Chriſt is God.

For man indeed ought not to cover his head, foraſmuch as hee is the Image and glory of God: But the woman is the glory of the man. It is written that the Lord Ieſus<note n="l" place="margin">Luke. 22.41.</note> kneeled downe and prayed. So<note n="m" place="margin">Acts. 7.60.</note> did Saint <hi>Stephen;</hi> when hee prayed, though ſtones then were throwne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, where through hee preſently died. &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Acts. 9.40.</note> kneeled downe and prayed, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Acts. 20.36. and 21.5.</note> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe and prayed, &amp;c. And <hi>Davids</hi> ſaying is,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16242:112"/>which is appointed to bee read on every Sunday morning: O come let us worſhip and fall downe and<note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 95.6.

               <p>Moreover, concerning the reverence done by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up, when we make confeſſion of our Faith, it is to be conſidered, that then to ſit, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely; becauſe it is as it were a ſpeaking unto God. And ſitting is no geſture of reverence. When any civill perſon goeth unto his ſuperiour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth any matter unto him, hee will doe it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And thus to demeane our ſelves in ſpeaking to our ſuperiours, wee are taught even by the very light of<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.14 Thereout <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> willed <hi>Balak</hi> to riſe up.

Ought wee not then when wee make confeſſion of our faith unto our God, to ſtand up reverently? We read not in Scripture of any, that ſpake unto God, ſitting, but either kneeling or ſtanding, or fallen downe on the face, as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17.17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did: Kneeling commonly when they prayed; and ſtanding, in making confeſſion or profeſſion. It is recorded of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> that hee and all the Congregation<note n="r" place="margin">1 King. 8.14.22.55.</note> ſtood, whiles hee confeſſed or made acknowledgement of the goodneſſe of God towards them, and bleſſed the name of the Lord. And afterward when he fell to prayer, it appeareth hee<note n="s" place="margin">1 King. 8.54.</note> kneeled on his knees. It is alſo written that <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 18.22. Gen. 19.27.</note> ſtood before the Lord, whiles he ſpake unto him. Very many are the Scriptures, which mention the geſture of ſtanding before the Lord, in ſpeaking unto his Omnipotent Majeſtie. Whereas alſo the Church preſcribeth, <hi>That when the Lord Ieſus ſhall bee mentioned, due and lowly reverence ſhall bee done by all perſons preſent, as it hath beene accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; teſtifying by theſe outward, Ceremonies and geſtures
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16242:112"/>their inward humility, &amp;c.</hi> It is to bee underſtood, that not onely all are to bow the knee, when the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> is mentioned in ſaying the <hi>Beleefe,</hi> but alſo in the reading of the holy <hi>Goſpell,</hi> when as the the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> is mentioned therein. For which cauſe, that people may then performe that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> is it not requiſite that all ſtand up, whiles the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> (which is in the divine Service) is in reading?

                  <hi>part delivered:</hi> Good workes are not all of one ſort. For ſome are of themſelves and of their owne proper nature alwayes good: as to love God above all things, to love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, to honour thy father and mother, to honour the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, to give to every man that which is his due, and ſuch like. Other workes there bee, which conſidered in themſelves, without further reſpect, are of their owne nature meerly indifferent, that is, neither good nor evill, but take their denomination of the uſe and end whereto they ſerve; which workes having a good end, are called good workes, and are ſo indeed: but yet that commeth not of themſelves, but of the good end whereunto they are referred. Of this ſort of works is<note n="m" place="margin">Zechar. 7.5, 6.</note> faſting, &amp;c. <hi>In the firſt part of the</hi>

                  <hi>Homily of good workes, it is ſaid,</hi> Even as the picture graven or painted, is but a dead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the thing it ſelfe, and is without life, or any manner of moving: ſo be the workes of all<note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 64.6.</note> unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons before God. They doe appeare to bee lively workes, and indeed they be but dead, not availing to the everlaſting life. They be but ſhadowes and ſhewes of lively and good things, and not good and lively things indeed.<note n="*" place="margin">

When the Iewes asked of Chriſt, what they ſhould doe not worke good workes: he anſwered, This is the<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 6.29.</note> worke of God, to beleeve in im whom he ſent: ſo that he called faith the worke of God. And aſſoone as a man hath faith, anon he ſhall flouriſh in good workes: for faith of it ſelfe is full of good works, and<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> nothing is good without faith.<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Homily concerning good works, it is ſaid;</hi> Now to goe forward to the third part, that is, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of workes they be which ſpring out of true faith, and lead faithfull men unto everlaſting life. This cannot be knowne ſo well, as by our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe, who was asked of a certain great man the ſame queſtion, What<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 19.16, 17.</note> workes ſhall I doe (ſaid a Prince) to come to everlaſting life? To whom Ieſus anſwered, If thou wilt come to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, keepe the Commandements. So that this is to be taken for a moſt true leſſon taught by Chriſts owne mouth, that the workes of the morall Commandements of God be the very true workes of faith, which lead unto the bleſſed life to come. <hi>And of the third part of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid</hi>

For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing, yee may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>Timothy,</hi> that firſt all, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of thankes be made for all men: For Kings, and for<note n="ſ" place="margin">1.

                  <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> Obey them that have the rule over you. The Lord hath commanded his people by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying: If there ariſe a matter too hard for thee in judgement, between blood and blood, betweene plea and plea, and between ſtroke and ſtroke, betweene matters of controverſie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy gates: Then ſhalt thou ariſe, and get thee up into the place, which the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe: And thou ſhalt come unto the Prieſts the Levites, and unto the<note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 17.8. &amp;c.</note> Iudge that ſhall be in thoſe

That which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mentioned concerning the obedience of the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and the halfe Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> is written for all profeſſed Chriſtians to marke for an example, the which <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſpake and ſaid unto them: Yee have keept all that <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in<note n="*" place="margin">Ioſ. 22.1.2.</note> all that I commanded you. <hi>Salomons</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is hereto conſiderable: I counſell thee, to keepe the<note n="y" place="margin">Eccles. 8.1.</note> Kings commandement, and that in regard of the oath of God.

                  <hi>Homily againſt Swearing and perjury, it is ſaid:</hi> When Iudges require oaths of the people for declaration or opening of the truth, or for execution of Iuſtice, Swearing is lawfull. Alſo when men make faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſes with calling to witneſſe of the name of God, to keepe covenants, honeſt promiſes, ſtatutes, lawes, &amp; good cuſtomes, as Chriſtian Princes doe in their concluſions of peace, for conſervation of Common-wealths, and private
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16242:123"/>perſons promiſe their fidelity in Matrimony, or one to another in honeſty and true friendſhip: and all men when they doe ſweare to keepe common lawes, and locall ſtatutes, and good cuſtomes, for due order to bee had and continued among men, when ſubjects doe ſweare to bee true and faithfull to their King and Soveraigne Lord, and when Iudges, Magiſtrates and Officers ſweare truly to execute their Offices, and when a man would affirme the truth, to the ſetting forth of Gods glory, (for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people) in open preaching of the Goſpell, or in giving of good Counſell privately for their ſoules health: All theſe manners of ſwearing, for cauſes neceſſarie and honeſt, be lawfull. But when men doe ſweare of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, in reaſoning, buying and ſelling, or other dayly communications, (as many be common and great ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers) ſuch kinde of ſwearing is ungodly, unlawfull, and forbidden by the Commandement of God. For ſuch ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is nothing elſe but taking of Gods name in vaine.<note n="*" place="margin">P. 46, 47.</note> 
                  <hi>Afterward it is ſaid:</hi> Whoſoever ſweareth when he is required of a Iudge, let him be ſure in his conſcience that his oath have three conditions, and hee ſhall never need to be afraid of perjury. Firſt, hee that ſweareth, muſt ſweare truly, that is, he muſt (ſetting apart all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and affection to the parties) have the truth onely before his eyes, and for love thereof, ſay and ſpeake that which he knoweth to be truth, and no further. The ſecond is, he that taketh an oath, muſt doe it with judgement, not raſhly and unadviſedly, but ſoberly, conſidering what an oath is. The third is, he that ſweareth muſt ſweare in righteouſneſſe: that is, for the very zeale and love which he beareth to the defence of innocency, to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the truth, and of the righteouſneſſe of the matter or cauſe: all profit, diſpoſits all love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16242:124"/>unto the perſon for friendſhip, or kindred laid apart. <hi>That in communication wee ought not to ſweare, Chriſts words doe declare, where he ſaith;<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 5.34, 35, 36, 37.</note> Sweare not at all, neither by heaven, &amp;c. (by no creature) But let your communication be yea, yea: nay nay: for whatſoever is more then theſe, commeth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. The which Scripture, as it forbiddeth all manner of ſwearing in communication; ſo it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth to ſweare at any time by any thing, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the name of God onely. The Lord ſaith to the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>by</hi> Ieremiah: <hi>How ſhall I pardon thee for this? thy Children have forſaken me, and<note n="m" place="margin">Ier. 5.7.</note> ſworne by them that are no gods.</hi>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 50.</note> 
                  <hi>Homily of ſwearing, it is moſt memorably ſaid:</hi> To the intent you ſhould know how great and grievous an offence againſt God wilfull perjury is, I will ſhew you what it is to take an oath before a Iudge upon a booke. Firſt, when they laying their hands upon the Goſpell booke, doe ſweare truly to enquire, and to make a true preſentment of things wherewith they be charged, and not to let from ſaying the truth and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly, for favour, love, dread or malice of any perſon, as God may helpe them, and the holy Contents of that booke: They muſt conſider, that in that booke is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gods everlaſting truth, his moſt holy and eternall Word, whereby we have forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, and be made inheritours of heaven, to live for ever with Gods Angels and Saints, in joy and gladneſſe. In the Goſpell booke is contained alſo Gods terrible threats to obſtinate ſinners, that will not amend their lives, nor beleeve the truth of Gods holy Word, and the everlaſting pain prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in hell for Idolaters, Hypocrites, for falſe and vaine ſwearers, for perjured men, for falſe witneſſe barers,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16242:124"/>for falſe condemners of innocent and guiltleſſe men, and for them which for favour, hide the crimes of evill doers, that they ſhould not be puniſhed. So that whoſoever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for ſweare themſelves upon Chriſts holy Evangely, (or Goſpell) they utterly forſake Gods mercy, goodneſſe, and truth, the merits of our Saviour Chriſts Nativity, Life, Paſsion, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, they refuſe the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, promiſed to all penitent ſinners, the joyes of heaven, the companie with Angels and Saints for ever. All which benefits and comforts are promiſed unto true Chriſtian perſons in the Goſpell. And they ſo being forſworne upon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, doe betake themſelves to the devills ſervice, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all lies, falſhood, deceit, and perjurie, provoking the great indignation and curſe of God againſt them in this life, and the terrible wrath and judgement of our Saviour Chriſt, at the great day of the laſt judgement, when he ſhall juſtly judge both the quicke and the dead, according to their workes. For whoſoever forſaketh the truth, for love or diſpleaſure of any man, or for lucre and profit to himſelfe, doth forſake Chriſt, and with <hi>Iudas</hi> betray him. And although ſuch perjured mens falſhood be now kept ſecret, yet it ſhall be opened at the laſt day, when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of all mens hearts ſhall be manifeſt to all the world. And then the truth ſhall appeare, and accuſe them: and their owne conſcience, with all the bleſſed company of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall beare witneſſe truely againſt them. And Chriſt the righteous Iudge ſhall then juſtly condemne them to everlaſting ſhame and death. <hi>As in a great part of the booke intituled</hi> God and the King, <hi>we may find much divine inſtruction concerning taking a lawful oath, ſo where there is delivered the nature of an oath in generall, it is much remarkeable. It is * there ſaid,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:16242:125"/>An oath is a moſt ſacred bond, and with a ſecret terrour imprinted by the immediate ſinger of God in the taking thereof, doth ſo ſtraitly oblige the inmoſt ſoule and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that although many men bee obdurate unto other grievous ſinnes: yet they will be tender and ſenſible of the violation of an oath. Very often (ſaith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>) men provoke their wives whom they ſuſpect to bee adulterous, to cleere themſelves by an oath, which they would not doe, unleſſe they did beleve that thoſe which feare not adultery, may feare perjurie: For indeed (ſaith hee) ſome unchaſt women which have not feared to deceive their husbands by wantonneſſe, have beene afraid to uſe God unto them as a witneſſe of their chaſtitie. <hi>When one layeth his hands upon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell booke, and ſignifieth that according as he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the truth, ſo he expecteth and deſireth helpe from God and the contents of that booke, he ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by, or taketh for witneſſe the everlaſting word of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in praying for benefit by that word, according as then hee beareth witneſſe unto the truth. To ſweare therefore by the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting word of God is an high oath. For</hi> David <hi>ſaith, Thou haſt magnified thy word</hi>

In the common Almanacke it is delivered, that upon the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday of every Ember weeke, a Faſt is to be obſerved: And ſome ſay, that upon the Munday in every ſuch weeke alſo. And the 31 Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rendreth a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why faſting is to be in the foure Ember weekes; namely, becauſe then prayer is to be made unto God after an eſpeciall manner, for to ſend downe his Holy Spirit into thoſe, which receive holy orders on the Sunday next following.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16242:131"/>obey thy godly motions in righteouſneſſe and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> The faſting preſcribed to bee obſerved all the <hi>Lent,</hi> is an abſtinence from fleſh, an uſual abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from that which doth cheriſh blood with blood: according as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſignifieth to have abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſaying: I<note n="x" place="margin">Dan. 10.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> was mourning three full weekes. I ate no pleaſant bread, neither came fleſh nor wine in my mouth. It is obſerved alſo that in ancient times, in keeping a publike or private faſt, people tooke an auſtere repaſt, ſome coorſe fare in the Evening after abſtinence the whole day.<note n="*" place="margin">As ſome doe in theſe times.</note> For, to forfeit a Noones meale, and then to recompence themſelves at night, was not their uſe.</p>
               <p>Now concerning other faſtings &amp; at other times, read the whole Homily of the ſame. The Lord ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Ioel 2.12, 13, 15.</note> Turne ye even to me with all your heart, and with faſting, &amp;c. Gather the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſanctifie the congregation: aſſemble the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: gather the Children, and thoſe that ſucke the breaſts: let the Bridgroome goe forth of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet. The<note n="z" place="margin">Ionah 3.7, 8.</note> faſt of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> is thus proclaimed to bee: Let neither man nor beaſt, herd nor flocke taſte any thing, let them not feed nor drinke water: But let man and Beaſt be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turne every one from his evill way, and from the violence that is in their hands. The Lord by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſignifieth the true uſe of faſting by<note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 58.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> reproving the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their neglect of the ſame, ſaying: Behold, in the day of your faſt you finde pleaſure, and exact all your labours. Behold, yee faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the

Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen? a day for a man to afflict his ſoule? is it to bow downe his head as a Bulruſh? and to ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under him? wilt thou call this a faſt, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the faſt that I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to undoe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie burdens, and to let the oppreſſed goe free? and that yee beake every yoake? is it not to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poore that are caſt out, to thy houſe? when thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh?</p>
               <p>Moreover, that there ought to be made fervent prayer in the faſting dayes of the foure Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weekes, it is ſignified in an Exhortation at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating of an Elected Biſhop, where the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſaith: <hi>Brethren, it is written in the Goſpell of Saint</hi> Luke, <hi>that our Saviour Chriſt, continued the</hi>

                  <hi>whole night in the prayer, or ever that hee did chooſe and ſend forth his twelve Apoſtles. It is written alſo in the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apoſtles, that the Diſciples which were at</hi> Antioch <hi>did</hi>

Firſt, from whence or from what things we muſt returne. Truly we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from thoſe things, whereby wee have beene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, pluckt, and led away from God; and theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are our ſinnes, which as the holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth teſtifie, doe<note n="u" place="margin">Iſa. 59.2.</note> ſeparate God and us, and hide his face, that he will not heare us.</p>

                  </gap> the name of ſinne, not onely thoſe groſſe words and deeds, which by the common judgement of men, are counted to be filthy and unlawfull, and ſo conſequently abominable ſinnes: but alſo the filthy luſts and inward concupiſcences of the fleſh, which (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth) doe<note n="w" place="margin">Gal 5.16, 17. 1 Pet. 2.11. Rom. 7.23.</note> reſiſt the will and Spirit of God; and therefore ought earneſtly to be bridled and<note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> kept under. We muſt repent of the<note n="y" place="margin">Iſa. 44.20. Iſa. 59.13.</note> falſe and erroneous opinions that we have had of God, and the wicked ſuperſtition that doth breed of the ſame, the<note n="z" place="margin">Rev. 9.20.</note> unlawfull worſhipping and ſervice of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16242:133"/>God, and other like. All theſe things muſt they forſake, that will truely turne unto the Lord, and repent aright. For ſith that for ſuch things the<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4.6.</note> wrath of God commeth upon the children diſobedience, no end of puniſhment ought to be looked for, as long as we continue in ſuch things. Secondly, we muſt ſee unto whom we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. The Lord ſaith: Returne as farre as unto mee. We muſt labour that we doe returne as farre as unto him, and that we doe never ceaſe nor reſt, till we have<note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 3.12.13 14. Act. 17.27.</note> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and taken hold upon him. But this muſt be done by<note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note> faith. For ſith that God is a Spirit, he can by no other meanes be apprehended and taken hold upon. Therefore thirdly we are to conſider, by whom we muſt returne unto God, becauſe we have of our owne ſelves nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us to God, and doe no leſſe flee from him, after our fal, then our firſt Parent <hi>Adam</hi> did, who when he had ſinned, did ſeeke to<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 3.8.</note> hide himſelfe from the ſight of God: Wee have therefore neede of a Mediatour to bring and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us unto him, who from our ſinnes is angry with us. The ſame is<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 1.22.</note> Ieſus Chriſt. And hee himſelfe in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell doth cry out and ſay, I am the<note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 14.6.</note> way, the truth and the life, no man commeth to the Father but by mee.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 259.</note> Fourthly, as concerning the manner of our returning: firſt, he will have us to returne unto him with our<note n="g" place="margin">Ioel 1.12.</note> whole heart, whereby he doth remove and put away all hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, leſt the ſame might juſtly be ſaid unto us: This people draweth neare unto me with their mouth, and worſhip me with their lips, but their<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 15.8.</note> heart is far off from me. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he requireth a ſincere and pure love of godlineſſe, and of the true worſhipping and ſervice of God, that is to ſay, that forſaking all maner of things that are repugnant &amp; contrary unto Gods will, we do give our<note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 22.26.</note> hearts unto him, and the<note n="k" place="margin">Luke 10.27.</note> whole ſtrength of our bodies and ſoules. Here
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16242:134"/>therefore is nothing left unto us, that wee may give unto the world, and unto the luſts of the fleſh.

                  <hi>Homily of Repentance there are declared ſome cauſes, which ſhould the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther move us unto repentance.</hi> As firſt the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, who in ſo many places of the holy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, doth bid us returne unto him. Therefore we muſt take good heed unto our ſelves, leſt whereas we have already by our manifold ſinnes and tranſgreſsions, provoked and kindled the wrath of God againſt us, wee doe by breaking<note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 3.2. Mat. 4.17. Mar. 6.12. Luke 13.3.</note> this his Commandement, double our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ſo heape ſtill damnation upon our owne heads by our daily offences and treſpaſſes, whereby we provoke
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16242:135"/>the eyes of his Majeſtie, we doe well deſerve (if he ſhould deale with us according to his juſtice) to be put away for ever from the<note n="x" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.8.9</note> fruition of his glory.<note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> How much more then are we worthy of the endleſſe torments of Hell, if when we be ſo gently called againe after our rebellion, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to returne, we will in no wiſe hearken unto the voyce of our heavenly Father, but walke ſtill after the<note n="z" place="margin">Deut. 29.19, 20.</note> ſtubbornneſſe of our owne hearts. The ſecond cauſe that ſhould move us to repent, is, the moſt comfortable and ſweet promiſe, that the Lord our God did of his mcere mercy and goodneſſe joyne unto his Commandement. For he doth not onely ſay, Returne unto me, O Iſrael: but alſo<note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 4.1.</note> if thou wilt returne, and put away all thine abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of my ſight, thou ſhalt never be moved. The third cauſe which ſhould move us to repent, is the filthineſſe of ſinne which in ſuch, that as long as wee doe abide in it, God cannot but<note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 5.4, 5, 6. Pſ. 66.18.</note> deteſt and abhorre us; neither can there be any hope that we ſhall enter into the heavenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, except we be firſt made<note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 21.27.</note> cleane and purged from it. But this will never be, unleſſe<note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 9.6. Eph. 4.22, 23, 24.</note> forſaking our former life, we doe with our whole heart returne unto the Lord our God, and with a full purpoſe of amendment of life, flee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mercy, taking ſure hold thereupon through<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 3.25. Gal. 5.6.</note> faith in the blood of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. The fourth cauſe which ſhould move us to repentance, is the uncertainty and brittleneſſe of our owne lives, which is ſuch, that wee cannot aſſure our ſelves, that wee ſhall live one houre, or one halfe quarter of it. Which by experience we doe finde daily to be true, in them that being now merry and luſty, and ſometimes feaſting and banquetting with their friends, doe fall ſuddenly dead in the ſtreetes, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles under the Board when they are at meate. Theſe daily examples, as they are moſt dreadfull and terrible,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16242:136"/>ſo ought they to move us to ſeeke for to bee at<note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20. 1 Cor. 6.17.</note> one with our heavenly Iudge, that we may with a good<note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 5 9, 10, 11. 1 Iohn 2.28.</note> conſcience appeare before him, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe him for to call us, whether it be<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 24.42, 43, 44, 46.</note> ſuddenly or otherwiſe, for we have no more Charter of our life, then they have. But as wee are moſt certaine that we ſhall dye, ſo are we moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine when we ſhall dye. For our life doth lye in the hand of God, who will take it away when it<note n="i" place="margin">Pſ. 31.15.</note> pleaſeth him. And verily when the higheſt Summer of all, which is Death, ſhall come, he will not be ſaid nay: but we muſt bee pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be preſent before the<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 9.27. 1 Pet. 1.17.

For ſuddenly ſhall the wrath of the Lord breake forth, and in thy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhalt thou be deſtroyed, and ſhalt periſh in the time of vengeance. <hi>And afterward it is ſaid,</hi> Specially when thou art either by the preaching of Gods Word, or by ſome inward motion of his holy<note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note> Spirit, or elſe by ſome other means called unto repentance, neglect not the good occaſion that is miniſtred unto thee, leſt when thou wouldeſt repent, thou<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 17.4, 5.</note> haſt not the grace for to doe it.

                  <hi>MY duty towards God is, to beleeve in him, to feare him, and to love him with all my heart, with all my minde, with all my ſoule, and with all my ſtrength.

                  <hi>The ſecond duty is to feare God.</hi> The feare of the Lord (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is to<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 8.13.</note> hate evill. And he there reckoneth up the foure chiefe evills, which are to be hated, namely, pride, and arrogancie, and the evill
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16242:138"/>way, and a froward mouth. <hi>David</hi> ſaith: Let all the earth<note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 33.8.</note> feare the Lord: let all the Inhabitants of the world ſtand in awe of him. <hi>Peter</hi> intimateth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to profeſſors of Chriſtianitie, why they ſhould feare God, ſaying: Foraſmuch as yee call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every mans work, paſſe the time of your ſojourning here in<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.17.</note> feare. <hi>David</hi> declareth who truly feareth God, ſaying: Bleſſed is the man that<note n="d" place="margin">Pſ. 112.1. as it is in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service tranſlation.</note> feareth the Lord, hee delighteth greatly in his Commandements.

They that feare the Lord, will ſeeke that which is well pleaſing unto him, and they that love him, ſhall bee filled with the Law. They that feare the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and humble their ſoules in his ſight. They<note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 66.5.</note> tremble at Gods Word, they dread to tranſgreſſe<note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 2.10.</note> any part of it. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with<note n="i" place="margin">Pſ 2.11.</note> trembling. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Bee not high minded, but<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 11.20, 21.</note> feare.

The third is, <hi>To love God with all our heart, with all our minde, with all our ſoule, and with all our ſtrength.</hi> To love God is to love that which God is, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heavenly<note n="m" place="margin">1 Iohn 1.5.</note> light,<note n="n" place="margin">1 Iohn 4.7.8.16.</note> charity,<note n="o" place="margin">Pro. 8.12, 14.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16242:139"/>in Scripture ſaid to be Light, Charity, Wiſedome. Hence Chriſt ſaith, Yee are my<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 15.14.</note> friends (or lovers) if yee doe whatſoever I command you. This is the<note n="q" place="margin">2 Ioh. 5.3.</note> love of God, (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) that wee keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and his Commandements are not grievous. Againe he ſaith, This is<note n="r" place="margin">2 Ich. 6.</note> love, that wee walke after his Commandements.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Chriſt ſaith, If yee<note n="s" place="margin">Ioh. 14.15.21 23.24.</note> love me, keepe my commandements. He that hath my commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth mee. If a man love me, he will keepe my words. He that is of God,<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 8.47.</note> heareth Gods words. The entrance of Gods words giveth<note n="u" place="margin">Pſ. 119.130.</note> light. God is a<note n="w" place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note> ſpirit of light, a ſpirit of love, and a ſpirit of eternall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. They therefore that love this Holy Spirit, bleſſed for ever, cannot but love his nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie. They delight to have heavenly<note n="x" place="margin">Pſ. 43.3.</note> light come more and more into their underſtanding, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to<note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 5.2. 1 Cor. 16.14.</note> walke in love, They unfainedly deſire to doe all things in<note n="z" place="margin">1 Sam. 18.5.

The Lord ſaith by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Yee ſhal ſeeke me, and find me, when yee ſhall ſearch for me with your<note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 29.13.</note> whole heart. The Lord Ieſus ſaith: If any man come to me, and<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 14.26.</note> hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea, and his owne life alſo, hee cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. <hi>To hate,</hi> in this place ſignifieth to love leſſe, as it is obſerved to ſignifie ſo in ſundry<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 29.31.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16242:139"/>for the Lords ſake left not onely their earthly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but their friends, wives and children, yea and their owne bodily lives, they in ſome meaſure loved God, as the commandement requireth. So ſuch as unfainedly ſtrive to be more and more dead unto<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 6.11.</note> ſinne, to bee more and more buried with Chriſt in his<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 6.4.

                  <note place="margin">The fift duty, to thanke God.</note> And this duty is to bee done within the ſpirit, in bearing a gratefull minde<note n="x" place="margin">Eph. 5.20.</note> continually unto God for all his mercies. So did the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe ſaid, My ſoule doth<note n="y" place="margin">Luk. 1.46.47.</note> magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour. So did <hi>David,</hi> when hee ſaid, Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and al that is within me bleſſe his Holy name.<note n="z" place="margin">Pſ. 104.1.2.</note> Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits. Concerning thanking God outwardly, ſee Chapter 44.<note place="margin">The ſixt duty, To truſt wholy in God.</note> The ſixt duty is, <hi>to put our whole truſt in him.</hi> We are ſaid to truſt wholy in God, when wee<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 37.7.</note> reſt on him, and<note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 37.5.</note> depend totally upon him with hope of receiving his promiſes, wee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doing our parts in keeping the<note n="c" place="margin">2 Kings. 18.4.5.6.</note> conditions, wherewith his promiſes are made. Truſt or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God proceedeth partly out of knowledge of Gods Attributes or properties: as it is written, They that know thy<note n="d" place="margin">Pſ. 9.10.</note> Name will put their truſt in thee, wherefore <hi>David</hi> having experience of Gods goodneſſe in his deliverance from the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſaid: I will love thee, O Lord my ſtrength. The Lord is my rocke, and my fortreſſe, and my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: my God, my ſtrength, in whom I will<note n="e" place="margin">Pſ. 18.1.2.3.</note> truſt, my Buckler, and the horne of my ſalvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee praiſed: ſo ſhall I bee ſaved from mine enimies. It proceedeth alſo from beliefe in God and in his word, (which beliefe God graciouſly giveth unto thoſe, that feare him and diligently pray for the ſame) as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifieth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſaying: In whom wee have boldneſſe and

                  <note place="margin">The ſeventh duty, to call upon God.</note> And that is, to pray unto him. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, offer unto God thankeſgiving, and pay thy vowes unto the moſt High: and<note n="h" place="margin">Pſ. 50.14.15:</note> call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.

               <p>
                  <hi>IN the Service of Matrimony the Duties of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons are very Divinely delivered. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands duty briefly is comprehended in theſe words:</hi> Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded Wife, to live together after Gods Ordinance, in the holy eſtate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour, and keepe her in ſickneſſe and in health? and forſaking all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepe thee onely unto her, ſo long as you both ſhall live. <hi>And in the laſt prayer of Matrimony, where it is ſaid:</hi> That this man may<note n="q" place="margin">Eph. 5.25, 26 27, 28.</note> love his Wife, according to thy Word, as Chriſt did love his Spouſe the Church, who gave himſelfe for it, loving and cheriſhing it, even as his owne fleſh.</p>

                  <hi>Homily concerning the ſtate of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it is ſaid unto the Huſband,</hi> Learne thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou deſireſt to be voide of all theſe miſeries, if thou deſireſt to live peaceably and comfortably in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, how to make thy earneſt prayer to God, that hee would governe both your hearts by the Holy Spirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the Devils power, whereby your concord may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine perpetually. But to this prayer muſt be joyned a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular diligence, whereof Saint <hi>Peter</hi> giveth this precept, ſaying, You<note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note> Husbands, deale with your Wives according to knowledge, giving honour to the Wife, as to the weaker Veſſel, &amp; as unto them that are heires alſo of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. This precept doth particularly pertaine to the Husband: for he ought to be the leader and author of love, in cheriſhing and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16242:146"/>concord, which then ſhall take place, if he will uſe moderation, and not tyranny, and if he<note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.3. Eph. 5.21. 1 Pet. 3.7. Rom. 12.6.</note> yeeld ſomething to the woman. For the woman is a weake creature, not indued with like ſtrength &amp; conſtancy of minde, therfore they be the ſooner diſquieted, and they be the more prone to all weake affections and diſpoſitions of minde, more than men bee, and lighter they be, and more vaine in their fantaſies and opinions. Theſe things muſt bee conſidered of the man, that he be not too<note n="t" place="margin">Col. 3.19.</note> ſtiffe, ſo that hee ought to<note n="u" place="margin">Prov. 19.11.</note> winke at ſome things, and moſt gently expound<note n="w" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> all things, and to<note n="x" place="margin">Eph. 4.2, 3.</note> forbeare.</p>

                  <hi>Homily it is alſo delivered:</hi> God forbid that a man ſhould<note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 5.28.29. Mal. 2.14. Col 3.19. Prov. 5.18, 19. 1 Pet. 3.7. 1 Cor. 13.4.5.</note> beate his wife, for that is the greateſt ſhame that can be, not ſo much to her that is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as to him that doth the deed. Let there be none ſo grievous fault to compell you to beate your Wives. But what ſay I, your Wives? No, it is not to bee borne with, that an honeſt man ſhould lay hands on his<note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 16.6.</note> maidſervant to beate her. Wherefore, if it be a great ſhame for a man to beate his bondſervant, much more<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> rebuke it is, to lay violent hands upon his free woman. And this thing may be well underſtood by the lawes which the Panims have made, which doth diſcharge her any longer to dwell with ſuch an Husband, as unworthy to have any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company with her, that doth ſmite her. For it is an extreame point, thus ſo vilely to intreat her like a ſlave, that is fellow to thee of thy life, and ſo joyned unto thee before time, in the neceſſary matters of thy living. And therefore a man may well liken ſuch a man (if he may bee called a man, rather then a wilde beaſt) to a killer of his father or his Mother, &amp;c. <hi>Reade the remaining deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, wherin is declared how monſtrous and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a wickedneſſe it is, for a man to uſe any manner
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16242:147"/>of violence or roughneſſe to the perſon of his Wife; and alſo ſundry more duties are Divinely preſcribed for the Husbands obſervation.</hi>

                  <hi>Now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Duty of the wife unto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who oftentimes by her neglect of the duties which ſhe is bound to performe unto her Huſband, pulleth upon and againſt her ſelfe many unkindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which would in no wiſe come to paſſe, if ſhee had conſcience and care to doe her duties. And the wives dutie is briefly compriſed, where it is ſaid,</hi> I take thee to my wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worſe, for richer, for poorer, in ſickneſſe and in health, to love, cheriſh, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, till death us depart, according to Gods holy ordinance. <hi>And in the laſt prayer of Matrimony her duty is divinely ſignified, where it is prayed for, ſaying:</hi> And alſo that this woman may be<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 29.11, 12, 17. and 30.1 and 26.8.</note> loving and amiable to her husband as <hi>Rachel,</hi> wiſe as<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 27.9, &amp;c</note>

                  <hi>Homily concerning the ſtate of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it is ſaid:</hi> Shall the wife abuſe the gentleneſſe and humanity of her husband? and, at her pleaſure, turne all things<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 14.1. Ecclus. 42.6.</note> upſide downe? No ſurely. For that is farre repugnant againſt Gods Commandement. For thus doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preach to them, Ye wives, be ye<note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1, 2. Gen. 3.16. Tit. 2.4.5. Eph. 5.24.</note> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to your owne husbands. To obey, is another thing than to controule and command; which yet they may doe to their Children and family: but as for their husbands, them muſt they obey, and ceaſe from commanding, and performe ſubjection. For this ſurely doth nouriſh concord very much, when the wife is ready at hand at her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16242:147"/>commandement, when ſhee will apply her ſelfe to his will, when ſhee endeavoureth her ſelfe to ſeeke his<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.3.34.</note> contentation, and to doe him pleaſure, when ſhee will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew all things what might offend him. For thus will moſt truely be verified the ſaying of the Poet, A good wife by obeying her husband, ſhall beare the rule, ſo that he ſhall have a delight and a gladneſſe, the ſooner at all times to returne home unto her. But on the contrary part, when the wives be ſtubborne, froward, &amp; malapert, their husbands are compelled thereby to abhorre and flee from their owne houſes, even as they ſhould have battaile with their enemies. <hi>And</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. <hi>242.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>afterward it is ſignified,</hi> That when wives through frailty and infirmitie have done amiſſe, they beware that they ſtand not in their faults and wilfulneſſe: but rather let them acknowledge their follies, and ſay, My husband, ſo it is, that by my anger I was compelled to doe this or that, forgive it mee, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I will take better heed. Thus ought the woman more readily to doe, the more they be ready to offend. And they ſhall not onely doe this to avoid ſtrife and debate: but rather in the reſpect of the Commandement of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it in this forme of words, Let wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be ſubject to their owne<note n="k" place="margin">Eph. 5.22, 23, 24. 1 Cor. 11.3.</note> husbands as to the Lord: for the husband is the head of the woman, as Chriſt is the head of the Church. Here you underſtand, that God hath commanded, that ye ſhould acknowledge the authority of the husband, and referre to him the honour of obedience. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in that place before rehearſed, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.5.6.</note> Matrons did in former time decke themſelves, not with Gold and Silver, but in putting their whole hope in God, and in obeying their husbands, as <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him Lord, whoſe daughters yee bee (ſaith he) if yee follow her example.

                  <hi>afterward it is alſo delivered:</hi> Obey thy husband, take regard of his requeſts, and give heede unto him, to perceive what he requireth of thee, and ſo ſhalt thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, and live peaceably in thy houſe. And beyond all this, God ſhall follow thee with his benediction, that all things ſhall well proſper, both to thee and to thy Husband, as the<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 128.</note> Pſalme ſaith. This let the wife have ever in minde, the rather admoniſhed thereto by the apparell of her<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.5, 7, 8.</note> head, whereby is ſignified, that ſhe is under covert or obedience of her husband.

For if it bee not lawfull for the woman to have her head<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.6, 14, 15.</note> bare, but to beare thereon the ſigne of her power, (or the power over her) whereſoever ſhe goeth: more is it required that ſhe declare the thing that is meant thereby. <hi>In the prayer to be read after the wed with the Ring, The dutie both of man and wife is delivered,</hi> That as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> lived faithfully together, ſo theſe perſons may ſurely performe and keepe the vow and covenant betwixt them made (whereof this Ring given and received is a token and pledge) and may ever remaine in perfect love and peace together, and live according to thy Lawes.</p>

And being but one, ſhee can doe all things: and remaining in her ſelfe, ſhe maketh all things new: and in all ages entring into holy ſoules, ſhee maketh them friends of God, and Prophets. For God loveth none but him, that dwelleth with Wiſdome. For ſhe is more beautiful than the Sunne, and above all the order of the Starres, being compared with the light, ſhee is found before it. There are two Holy Scriptures which tell us, what is wiſdome and underſtanding.

               <p>IN the Service afore the Communion, and in the Rubricke afore the ſpeciall Abſolution it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we are bound to be in Charity with every body of mankind, as we would that God ſhould be mercifull unto us.

                     <hi>T.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 179.</note> Homily of the Paſſion, it is ſaid: <hi>It is not meete that we ſhould crave forgiveneſſe of our great offences at Gods hands, and yet will not forgive the ſmall treſpaſſes of our neighbour againſt us. We doe call for mercie in vaine, if we will not ſhew mercy to our neighbours.

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16242:168"/>him. For under this condition doth God forgive us, if we forgive other. It becommeth not Chriſtian men to bee hard one to another, nor yet to thinke their neighbour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be forgiven. For howſoever unworthy he is, yet is Chriſt worthy to have thee to do thus much for his ſake, he hath deſerved it of thee, that thou ſhouldeſt forgive thy neighbour.

Whereſoever yee finde the ſpirit of arrogancie, and pride, the ſpirit of envie, hatred, contention, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, murder, extortion, witchcraft, necormaniec, &amp;c. aſſure your ſelves, that there is the ſpirit of the Devill, and not of God, albeit they pretend outwardly to the world never ſo much holineſſe. For as the Goſpell teacheth us, the ſpirit of the Ieſus is a good ſpirit, and Holy ſpirit, a ſweet ſpirit, a lowly ſpirit, a mercifull ſpirit, full of charity and loue, full of forgiveneſſe and pitty; not rendring evill for evill, extremity for extremity, but overcomming evill with good, and remitting all offence even from the heart. According to which rule, if a man live uprightly, of him it may be ſafely pronounced, that hee that the Holy Ghoſt with hin him: If not, then it is a plaine taken, that he doth
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16242:168"/>uſurpe the name of the Holy Ghoſt in vaine.</hi> Chriſt teacheth us thus to pray:<note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 6.12.</note> Forgive us our treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as wee forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us. And he addeth, For if ye<note n="x" place="margin">Mat 6.14, 15:</note> forgive men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes. In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable it is ſaid, O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt mee: ſhouldeſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow ſervant, even as I had pity on thee? and his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.

Remember the Commandements, and beare no malice to thy neighbour: remember the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Higheſt, and winke at ignorance. Some will ſay, they can forgive, but not forget. But in ſo doing they doe not well.

                  <p>THough wee heare it (or at leaſt ſhould often heare it) read in the ſacred Letaine. <hi>From all Sedition and privie conſpiracie, good Lord deliver us;</hi> yet how prone are many in the world thereunto! Such conſider not what the Goſpell ſaith: There is no<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 13.1.2.</note> power but of God. The powers that bee, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. Such conſider not that other moſt memorable oracle of God delivered by S. <hi>Peter:</hi> Submit your ſelves to<note n="y" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.14</note> every ordinance of man for the Lords ſakes, whether it be to the King, as Supreame,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:16242:199"/>or unto governours, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well. If ſuch as are ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inclined would ſometimes reade through the whole Homily of obedience, and the whole Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt diſobedience and wilfull rebellion, and alſo would call to minde the end of all ſeditious ones, and of all privie conſpiratours in former times, even in all privie conſpiratours in former times, even in all ages and almoſt in all places, they by the grace of Chriſt might be of a cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpoſition. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from God Almighty denounceth, that hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife,<note n="z" place="margin">Gal. 5.20.21.</note> ſeditions, hereſies (or ſects, or fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) envyings, &amp;c. Are workes of the fleſh: and that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God. And now for concluſion about mentioning particular ſins, referring every devout ſoule unto a diligent reading or hearing of the whole Bible, and to obſerve thereout what the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath delivered and preſcribed for every one in his ſeverall vocation and ſtate, either to doe, or to leave undone and to ſhunne: and alſo to a moſt ſerious ſearch of the whole divine Service of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for to performe every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duty mentioned therein, which concerneth him; and to ſhunne whatſoever it is there dehorted from, let us heare what holy Church delivereth unto us in the firſt Homily<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:16242:204"/>containe the wrath and indignation of God, and his threatnings; which ſhould certifie them, that as they doe over boldly preſume of Gods mercy, and live diſſolutely: So doth God ſtill more and more withdraw his mercy from them, &amp; he is ſo provoked therby to<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 2.4, 5, 6, 8.</note> wrath at length, that he deſtroyeth ſuch preſumers many times ſuddenly.

Wherefore let us follow the counſell of the Wiſe man,<note n="h" place="margin">Ecclus. 5.7.</note> Let us make no tarrying to turne unto the Lord: Let us not put off from day to day, for ſuddenly ſhall his wrath come, and in time of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he will deſtroy the wicked.</p>
